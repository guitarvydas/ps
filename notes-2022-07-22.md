Are you aware of Twitch and live-streaming and Discord?  Sounds utterly useless to me, but, some people watch this stuff instead of reading.

You know who Rick Beato is.  Why does he have millions of subscribers?  Why don't these subscribers just read books and stop watching Beato?

Academics break down and document their knowledge in papers.  Regular people simply want to get a job done.  They don't want to read papers, they don't want an academic-level wall of details.  There is a missing niche in our literature - and maybe new tech, like Twitch, will fill the gap?

What are you expert at, that you could share knowledge about?  If I step back, I realize that I am in awe of your ability to fix computers[+].  Maybe you should Twitch your next sessions at work, fixing machines.  Personally, I find it hard to break down and write up what I'm thinking about and have learned, but, I imagine that watching someone do this on a real project might impart nuggets of wisdom.  One can't fix machines without knowing a lot about how they tick.  This is something you know and few others do. This kind of knowledge is missing from education today.  I think that this would be like a long-distance apprenticeship, e.g. you work in B.C., but your apprentices migh be in India, China, etc.

[+] There is more, but, the "I can do this in my sleep" stuff should be easy to livestream.

Hints sought:  I think that I want to create video technical documentation / papers / cookbooks / ??? without having to deal with a cumbersome editing process.  (i.e. idea -> publish would be the ideal workflow).  Roughly 2-minute vignettes of heavy technical concepts. 

I'm thinking screencasts with voice-over (I guess).  Slide-shows of windows on my screen with a very visible mouse and slides (on the side or somewhere).

I'm poring over Descript tutorials and learning a lot of stuff that doesn't apply.  I would be happier to not have to read/watch/understand everything and to simply cut to the chase.

I'm a software deep techie and have done song-writing/recording using DAWs (Ableton, Logic) (iMovie and DaVinci Resolve for some video).  I'm recently retired, and, have a lot less time on my hands than I would have expected (I am busier now than when I worked for a living).

I know something about audio production workflow, but probably have no clue about video production workflow.  In essence, I'm an empty vessel.

I've written some 400+ blogs, but, think that (x,y) writing is being replaced by (x,y,t) technology.

I would like to forget everything I know about DAWs and video production and jump into the future.

Ideas, hints about workflow, and, pointers to things that I should read & watch would be helpful.  

Thanks.

It doesn't hurt to ask: is there a seniors / hobbyist pricing plan?  I think that I'm going to need a Pro plan, but am feeling the pinch of restricted cashflow (retirement).  I used to be a software consultant and want to create "papers" on various technologies (and I plan to publish books).  I've been blogging, but want to change to something more modern (if painless).

Thanks

(1) the Flyde link is not working for me
(2) UNIX invented FBP, also
(3) method calling does not faithfully implement message passing (i.e. every Smalltalk implementation I've seen does not implement message passing ; (especially egregious in Smalltalk, since Smalltalk has closures ("blocks")
(4) I've been whittling my problem down while trying to think of what to implement first in Flyde.  I'm going to share this with you, without asking you to work on this problem (unless you think that it is super easy).  ATM, I think that the simplest part of the problem is to generate a target filename given a source filename and a target directory.  The source directory structure gets flattened all generated filenames point to the same target directory (this is not very general, but is good enough for my problem - YAGNI).  I've drawn up the component in draw.io, along with 3 examples of inputs vs. outputs.  I think that there are 2 kinds of components - Leaves (blue) which execute code and Containers (gray) which route messages between ports.  I think that one could use Python (or JS, or Bash, or, ...) for these components.  I will include a .png of the drawing and examples below.  If Flyde wants to solve the problem differently, I would enjoy learning how.  I've also drawn - mostly for myself - the component with 3 synchronous ports (reset, step, more?) which would make implementation of the components easier (or, at least I think so at this moment :-).  In my mind "sync ports" are functions and "async ports" are things that operate on FIFO queues.  (More details, discussion, available).
