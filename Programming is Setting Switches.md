Computers are machines.  

Computers are more flexible than mechanical machines.

When we build a mechanical machine, we "program" it by designing-in mechanical doo-dads, like gears and pulleys and ... .

For example, textile looms.  My mother's loom can be set up to produce big swaths of cloth or thin belt-like sashes.  The loom is a machine.  Reprogramming the loom to do sashes instead of swaths is possible, but slow and a PITA.

When we build an electronic machine, we "program" it by designing-in eletrical doo-dads.  

We found that we could design-in ON/OFF switches. AKA "front panel".

Then, we found that we could use numerical codes instead of actual mechanical switches.  

We designed electronic switches that were activated by electrical codes instead of by physical finger-pushing.  AKA "programs" and "scripts".

Then, we found that we could change the behaviour of the machines simply by setting the switches in different configurations.

This graduated to scripting the soft switches.  

We would change the scripts, and the *scripts* would change the configurations of the switches, and the machines would change their behaviour.

We ended up using electronic machines for all kinds of things like,
- Balance sheet what-ifs (spreadsheets)
- games
- phones
- flying rockets to other planets and moons
- etc.
