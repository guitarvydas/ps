If it weren't for dynamic languages, Racket might not have macros at all.

There is a huge difference between thinking something up and optimizing it after-the-fact.

To make a language compilable, you have to **change** the language and remove all features that are bicycles for the mind.

Wish: a dynamic language *lint*er that suggests changes to make the (dynamic) code more compilable.  Gradual compilability.  Trackable.  Provenance.
