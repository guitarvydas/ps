I believe that a drawing-based program should *add* information to a program instead of simply re-writing existing textual representations.  

A drawing should contain text where it is appropriate, and, it should contain graphics (drawings) where appropriate and useful.  

For example, the text-based statement `a = b + c` is sufficiently expressive and well-understood.  There is no reason to express `a = b + c` as a drawing.  

It is much more difficult, though, to express networks of interconnected components in textual form, and, that is where diagrams *add* information to programming.  

Note that we already use diagrams in programming, in the form of drawings of computer networks, but we tend not to formalize the syntax for such drawings.
