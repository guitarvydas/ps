> in FBP, we can sequence actions too by putting one box before another? So when do I chose StateCharts over FBP?

Correct.

I split (AKA divide and conquer) Control Flow from Object definition.

Sequencing in ė and in FBP, etc. is done by snapping components together (like LEGO blocks).  

You can hook components up in series, or, you can hook components up in parallel.

With textual programming, you get only one choice - sequencing is defined by writing lines of code one after another.  The lines can include calls to subroutines, but, those calls are sequenced by the top level sequence of lines.

It is *possible* to use textual programming languages to write asynchronous code, but, you are reduced to essentially using ad-hoc assembler, in the form of threading libraries and their APIs, and low-level concepts like semaphores, locks, thread safety, priorities, functions, etc., etc.  You must be careful how you sequence this kind of code.  Some people have a knack for getting this right, most don't.  By default, we write totally synchronous code and drop that code into envelopes called "processes", hoping that all of our problems will be solved.  In fact, that kind of solution only solves the problems that were deemed important by the developer(s) of the threading libraries and operating systems.  If you want to do something different - like IoT, blockchain, robotics, internet - tough luck, you are on your own and you have to use ad-hoc assembler-level APIs for such ideas.

I think that HSMs + ė allow you to imagine these kinds of ideas and to snap components together to implement such ideas.

To me, the crux of the matter is 0D - lack of implicit synchronization.  You can create synchronized components using 0D, but it is much harder to create 0D with synchronized components.  The result of doing everything with implicitly synchronized components is brittle code, bugs and bloatware.  Imagine an intricate Swiss watch with lots of tightly-coupled gears.  Break one tooth off of one gear and the whole thing fails.  In a non-sychronized system, say a bunch of independent people at a business meeting, if one person fails to show up, the meeting can go on.  Reuse - can you pull one gear out of a Rolex and use it in a Swatch?  Sometimes, yes, but, in general, no.

HSMs + ė provide a 0D toolkit.


Sequencing and 

I think of HSMs for building synchronous code.

I think of FBP, ė, etc., for building asynchronous code.

Most popular general purpose languages conflate the two issues (sync vs. async).  I claim that it is simpler to cleave the two issues apart and to treat each one with its own "DSL".

To build sync code, you can maintain sanity by creating nested objects, like nested Russian dolls.  For example, the "global variable problem" comes from the breaking of nesting (which would have been less likely to occur if we'd have used diagrams instead of characters).  Nesting in ASCII is represented by `{ ... }`

thread libraries - ad-hoc, assembler-like primitives for async

Convenience.

With LW you pay for convenience.  

Common Lisp defines every operation that you need (in fact, assembler defines everything you need.  What more could you possibly want? :-).  

LW has done a lot of UX fine-tuning and has been focussed and biased by their customer base.  

With open source, you get completeness, but, the final product is heavily influenced by the biases of the developer (typically biased towards completeness and efficiency (whatever that means :-)).  I have been forcing myself to use VScode (Python and JS).  I am not happy.  When I was forced to use emacs and Slime to write Common Lisp, I felt unhappy, too.

quickjs: make'd under ubuntu. Rethink: I'm losing focus and going down unnecessary ratholes.  I build a node.js-specific version of the code by scraping the .html file (and tacking a bit of node.js-specific stuff onto the front and tail).  The node.js version builds a 1-liner for the 'fab' app - which is what I really want.  My initial disgust was that the node.js version was not exactly the same as the .HTML version, and, is interpreted.  Yet, why do I care?  Let the O/S worry about how to run the 'fab' code.  Optimize later.  I think that I like Python better than JS because of type-checking and my impression that more programmers use/are-familiar-with Python.  If I can shell-out from Python, then I should be able to shell-out from Racket or CL or ...  Maybe I should be targeting Racket instead of Python?  My fear is that if I write an example in CL, no one will look at it.  My impression is that a Python version would get more eye-balls.  My supplemental fear is that I was misusing JS modules and that learning how to do that correctly would make HTML JS and node.js versions exactly the same.  Hmmm, JS and node.js and quickjs versions must be (slightly) different.

My point(s) using different words: text languages are based on 1950s biases (1 CPU, very little memory).  Text languages have been conquered, and I believe that Ohm-JS is the epitome of how to build them (including little embedded DSLs). The Great Reset: in 2022, we have multiple PUs and cheap memory.  Time to re-think how to achieve The Goal of Programming.  We, now, have hardware capable of displaying resizable, overlapping rectangles and need not be constrained to using text-only languages.  Parsing resizable, overlapping rectangles has not been conquered but is obtainable (I have built multiple POCs).  Thinking in terms of programming languages that use resizable, overlapping rectangles as part of their syntax opens a plethora of doors.  Programming theorists have boxed themselves into a corner by thinking that diagrams are "models" instead of "syntax".  It should be drop-dead easy to parse SVG elements (instead-of/in-addition-to characters) using Ohm-JS.  In fact, my d2f tool does exactly that - parses XML (??.graphml from draw.io editor) and converts it to textual pseudo-code which can be eaten by existing parsing technologies (such as Ohm-JS (surprise!)).  I don't parse ALL of XML, but, just a subset.  This is what programming languages do - they parse a very restricted subset of written prose and transpile it to assembler opcodes.
