What is an epicycle?

Today, for political correctness, we use the term workaround instead of the word epicycle. 

Epicycle comes from the Ptolemaic Universe that preceded Copernican thinking. 

We see that - for programming - the epicycle of using one in and one out, in a synchronous fashion, the way we think of functions at the moment, is breaking down.

We have all sorts of tells and aren't noticing.

One of the tells is that we think that callbacks are hard. 

Another tell it is that JavaScript programmers don't want to use monads and the other complicated forms of functional programming - epicycles - that are being developed to support the continued use of synchronous functions.

Anther tell is that multitasking is considered to be hard. 

Multitasking is quite simple.  It's on the order of about 10 bytes long. Why do we need operating systems that are thousands of bytes long?
