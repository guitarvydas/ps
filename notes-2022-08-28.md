This should be easy, but, I don't know how to do it (if it's not easy, I don't want to bother):

I want to set up a simple html file that contains an area for Sector Lisp source code, a button, and, an area for the eval'ed output.  When the button is pushed, Sector Lisp evals the source code and produces output which is dumped into the output area.

Suggestions welcome...
