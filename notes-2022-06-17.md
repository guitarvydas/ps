I'm a retired sw dev and just started using Kinopio...

Q:

I .think. that I want to build a "todo" space with 10's of random notes.

I .think. that I want to tag the notes, maybe in a hierarchical manner.  Like "book" and "[ ] - write about xxx"

I .think. that I want to make complex queries, like "not done" AND "book".

I don't see how to do this, yet.  I am willing to change my mindset...

I can see that I could do this with a "book" space, but, I'm not sure if that is the correct way to think in Kinopio.

(E.G. "book" and "todo" are potentially orthogonal - I .think. that I want to add "structure" after-the-fact.)

comments welcome...

Thanks!

Example usages help with SHU of Shuhari.

Is anybody using Kinopio as a programming IDE?
