# Diagrams of Code
## Diagram of a Component Containing Code - Leaf

![[das-Leaf.png]]

Commonly called a *function*.

## Diagram of a Container Component
![[das-Container.png]]

This diagram contains 
- Leaves, and, it contains 
- Connections (arrows).

## Discussion - Leaf

How many inputs can it have?  0-N

How many outputs can it have? 0-M.

## Discussion - Container
Is there restriction on what kinds of Components a Container can contain?

No.

A Container can contain any other kind of Component, Leaf or Container (recursive).

Can connections loop back to the same Component?  Yes.  This is called *feedback*.
Actually, for a pure *function*, N=1 and M=1.

For a UNIX command, N=1, M=2 (stdin, stdout, stderr).

For a "daemon", N=0.

## Discussion - Generalizing to Components.

Leaves and Containers look the same from the outside.

A diagram doesn't care about what is inside a Component - it might be a Leaf or it might be Container.

Let's call these Components.

In fact, a DaS diagram contains Components.

A DaS program cannot care how the Components are implemented - as Containers or Leaves.
