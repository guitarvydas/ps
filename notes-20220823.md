Wondering what to do next: we've been binge-watching Saul and have finished episode 7 (I think).  There are no more purchased episodes.  AFAICT the options are: (1) sit tight and await more info from you, (2) buy episodes on Austina's Apple ID, (3) buy episodes on Paul's Apple ID and share with you somehow, (4) create a new Apple ID and buy episodes with it, (5) figure out what Home Sharing is and proceed.  Advice?
