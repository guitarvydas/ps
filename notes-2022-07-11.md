# Structured Programming 2.0

- layers
- down -> commands
- up <- summaries
- across -- not permitted
- call/return -- not permitted
- analogy: business organization, biz ORG Charts
- composition through explicit communication, 
- if synchronization necessary, make it explicit
	- no implicit synchronization
		- no implicit comms
		- no implicit dependencies

# Orthogonal Programming Languages
GCC <- RTL - Fraser/Davidson, 
	- normalize all operands to a single kind
	- resolve operands later
- OCG <- Cordy
	- normalize all operands to *data descriptors*
	- generalization of RTL technique
	- uses declarative MIST to resolve operands - later
- Ohm-JS TDPL enables easy division between operators and operands
- Ohm-JS *applySyntactic<...>* makes for easy phrase-parsing
	- using operators (keywords, syntax)
	- using separate operands (operand-parsing rules)
- OOP 
	- model *operands*
		- (not for operators)
- λ-calculus for programming
	- models all values as a single type (callable function)
		- so-called "typed parameters" are sub-types
		- so-called "typed parameters" are destructurings of single input type (a block of data bytes)
		- so-called "typed return values" are destructurings of single output type
		- dimension *t* (time, history) is simply ignored
			- or modelled explicitly (painfully, noisily) as function parameters/returns
	- very similar to Cordy's *condition descriptors*

FBP non-popularity is due to marketing problem
- people don't "see" that there is a difference between functions and 0D
- akin to pre- and post-perspective Art - people didn't "see" the need for perspective in 2D drawing
- market education neeeded
- akin to “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” attributed to Henry Ford
- epicycles due to dependencies, workarounds that manage dependences (like *make*, *package managers*, etc.) instead of removing dependencies

You originally asked why FBP hadn't caught on.  IMO, the answer cannot be given without a foray into 0D.  I continue to struggle with finding ways to say "0D is important".

FBP's non-popularity is due to a marketing problem, needing much market education.
- People don't "see" that there is a difference between functions and 0D
- This is akin to pre- and post-perspective Art - people didn't "see" the need for perspective in 2D drawing
- This is akin to “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses” attributed to Henry Ford.
- We have developed epicycles due to dependencies and workarounds that manage dependences (like *make*, *package managers*, etc.), instead of removing dependencies.
- Programming should be easy, modern programming using state-of-the-art languages is not easy, though
- Tell: the notion that "multitasking is difficult".
- Tell: the notion that "distributed programming is difficult".
- If something looks difficult, invent a new notation to work with it.  
- Functional programming is a notation for working with calculators
- Multitasking, IoT, internet, music and video sequencers, robotics programs are not calculators.

I think that we're switching from (x,y) display technology (clay tablets, paper) to (x,y,t) technology (youtube, electronic displays, streaming).  I perceive substack to be of the (x,y) ilk.  Is that perception correct?  [background]: I'm wondering whether I should audio-record my blogs and books and post them to youtube, unless there is something else that I should consider...

newbie questions, elucidation needed:
(1) The scroll slug on the text-edit window seems not to work on my Macbook.  For example, I don't know how to scroll to top of the file, the scroll slug disappears if I try to hover over it.
(2) Some audio words fade out too quickly, the transcription is OK, but the audio is chopped off, e.g. "phrase" is transcribed correctly, but sounds like "phra"
(3) Audio levels look very low - from using DAWs, I would expect to find a "normalize audio" function but don't see it
(4) I expected that overdub will use my video clip for training, but it seems to want me to speak into the microphone ; I want to add one word ("to") in the middle of a sentence, but no voice is generated (I haven't done any explicit training)
background: I recording and edited a video using iMovie, then uploaded it to Descript
