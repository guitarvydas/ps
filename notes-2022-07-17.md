This thread got me thinking about why I don't like node-red, and, to veer off down multiple ratholes...

Node and wire is one of "the way"s.

As a DPL (diagrammatic programming language) node-red leaves something to be desired.

Programming languages are IDEs for the task of programming machines.

Consider notations from other more mature disciplines, e.g.
1. electronics schematics
2. construction blueprints
3. music scores.

1 is non-textual, and, node-and-wire.  

2 is non-textual, and, diagrammatic 

3 is non-textual, and, time-varying, and, hard real-time, and, teachable to 5-year olds.

A technical diagram is a strict subset of more general visual art, like programming languages are a strict subset of more general prose.

What jumps out at me as node-red's first-order deficiency is ... https://publish.obsidian.md/programmingsimplicity/2022-07-17-Notation+Suitability
