Not urgent: You're probably at the cottage...

I upgraded my robotic pool cleaner and have the old one sitting around.

Do you want the old one?  Free. You can check it out first.

Gathering dust:
- Rick Beato ear training course (online)
- Free if you want it
- I wish I had learned ear training decades ago.  I think that ear training is vital, but it was taught to me in a very boring manner...
- I would be happy to try to teach this in small chunks to Petras (and Vakaris), but, it is online and I will need to use my laughtop.
- (The course is part of a bundle that comes with a Music Theory Book (now online (I have the update)), guitar transcriptions and I don't remember what else)
- Beato used to teach music, was a producer, now runs a youtube channel (for teaching music and production).
