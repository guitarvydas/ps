... argh, I intended to listen-in-on the CRTD and Visual Syntax papers, but life got in the way...

FWIW: IMO, there is a chasm between Visualization and current programming languages.  PLs have hard-wired synchronization in them, while just about everything else in life (incl. diagrams) is asynchronous.  Programming in sync-based languages is difficult because it defies our intution.  [Note that even ethernet has NO synchronization built into it (backing off in random intervals and trying again is not synchronization).  Multitasking is async built on top of sync built on top of async.]
