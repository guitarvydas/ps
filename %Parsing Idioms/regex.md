REGEX is another DSL for specifying matches.  Parsing is more powerful than REGEXing, because parsing DSLs provide ways to define and call subroutines, where REGEX syntax does not include subroutines.  On the other hand, REGEX pattern matches are usually shorter than parse pattern matches.  Subroutines make it possible for parsers to match structured text (like programming languages) whereas REGEX is best at short line-oriented matching.  REGEX can find patterns in single lines of text (*structured*), whereas parsers can find patterns in big blocks of text (like progam files).  Compilers use REGEX technology to create *scanners* and parsing technology to do the rest of the heavy lifting.  Scanners act like front-ends to more heavy-duty parsers.  Scanners filter out simple string matches from input text and leave the rest of the work for parsers (and semantic analyzers, etc.)
