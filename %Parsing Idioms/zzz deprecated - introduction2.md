This is a cookbook of patterns (aka idioms) for using PEG[^peg] parsers.

I use the language Ohm, in the form of Ohm-JS, for examples.  See the appropriate section for my reasons for using Ohm.

I accentuate patterns that are easy in Ohm, but, hard-to-do using other parsers.  The other, more common patterns, I leave to other books on the subject of parsing.

Ohm / PEG is a DSL[^dsl] for creating parsers, unlike other technologies which tend to be DSLs for creating languages from the ground up.

[^peg]: PEG means Parsing Expression Grammar
[^dsl]: DSL mean Domain Specific Language.
