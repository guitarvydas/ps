In the mid-1900s it was harder to parse diagrams than it was to parse small bitmaps bound to hardware QWERTY keyboards (i.e. characters, text).

Today, we have better hardware and faster CPUs.

In the mid-1900s, it was considered unsuitable to use Early's algorithm, because it implied backtracking and "inefficiency".

Today, backtracking is easy with PROLOG and PEG.  Our CPUs are much faster, so, we are allowed not-to-care as much about "efficiency" (we can transfer our concern for machine efficiency to human efficiency).

MiniKanren has refined the concepts of PROLOG pattern-matching.

PEG has refined the concepts of parsing (sequencing) and backtracking (PROLOG).

Ohm-JS is language based on PEG.  Ohm-JS is "better" than raw PEG.
