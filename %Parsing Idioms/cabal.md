I jotted down some notes about PEG, hopefully arranged in anti-TL;DR order.

1.  PEG is a game-changing technology
2.  parsing ≣ pattern-matching
3.  PEG creates **parsers**, YACC describes **languages** from first principles
4.  PEG paper by Bryan Ford

The rest was too large to post on slack, so I will put it on my blog...

Don't expect a lack of opinions...

I was going for 80% truth and edited out all qualifications for succinctness.

I look forward to finally understanding the Haskell code after tonight...
