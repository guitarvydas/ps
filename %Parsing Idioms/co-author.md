Hi Patrick

Do you want to be listed as a co-writer or in the acknowledgements section (or neither) of my new booklet? ...

I have written a small cook-booklet on very basic parsing idioms using Ohm-JS.  Some of the examples were influenced (or directly copied) by answers in the help channel of the OhmLand discord.

I plan to release the contents for free on my blog and for $'s on leanpub.

If you are wish to participate as a co-writer, I will send you a dropbox link to the content.

At a minimum, the examples need to be checked for glaring errors / simplifications.

More details and previews on request.

I plan to release the contents for $'s on leanpub.  I am considering releasing the contents for free, too (blog? leanpub sample?  I don't know yet.)
