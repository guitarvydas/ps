# Solution Centric Notation
 I use the name SCN (Solution Centric Notation) to mean DSLs that are not generalized, but, are specialized for a particular problem.  
 
 I believe that, with Ohm-JS, programmers can build *several* SCNs for a specific problem instead of building generalized DSLs.  
 
 To me, SCNs are like batch-edit operations, and, you shoud be able to build an SCN in an afternoon without breaking a sweat.  
 
 If you use REGEX for projects, then you already use SCNs, albeit with a write-only syntax.
