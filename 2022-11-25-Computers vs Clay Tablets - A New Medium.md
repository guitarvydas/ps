Computers are a new medium the likes of which humanity hasn't seen for several 1,000s of years.

- sticks in wet clay
- inks and paints
- graphite and rubber erasers
- commonality: 2D notation, squish everything down to 2D, even if the phenomenon has more dimensions

# Computers
- allow humans to visualize 3D (and beyond?)
- using a 2D-only notation for programming is silly, under-utilizes abilities of the new medium
