Dear Rick Beato,

I  think that Pat Pattison does to words what you do to music.

> When traveling to last year’s [TAXI Road Rally](http://www.taxi.com/taxi-road-rally-2014.html), I found myself faced with a 5 hour flight. How did I spend that 5 hour flight? In the first four hours, I read Pat Pattison's latest book, [The Essential Guide to Rhyming 2nd Edition](http://patpattison.com/books/?id=2). What did I do in the 5th hour? I reread chapter 8, “Sonic Bonding.”   
  
> There are some stunning, drop-down-on-your-knees-in-awe revelations in that chapter. It begins with internal rhyme, then covers three forms of assonance (simple, hidden, family), alliteration, a new analysis of consonant families, concealed alliteration, and juncture, and caps off with voice leading and prosody (a musical technique applied to lyric writing/flow). Finally Pat pulls back the curtain to reveal the magic created by Robert Frost's 2-line poem [The Span of Life](http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-span-of-life/).  
  
> Five hours well spent, indeed.

Take music away from songs and what do you get?  Rap, beat-boxing.  How do you create tension and release using only those primitives?  It can be done, by crafting lyrics.

Put music back into the mix and what do you get?  

A great song.
