I'm unfinished on 3 fronts.

1. The biggest front is a diagram-to-python transpiler.  Began with focusing on 1-week [Wheel Reinvention Jam](https://handmade.network/p/307/eh/) and has carried on.  It's working (and is beginning to emit Lisp).  Converts "Hello World" from .drawio to .py.  I'm trying to document it, but that is going slowly due to niggly reasons (I use Unicode characters in the process and, just now, discovered that the transpiler fails in Safari and Chrome (but not Firefox) unless I enable UTF-8 view encoding.).  I am hoping to create a Makefile that builds from one end to the other, but am discovering that JS in .html is not compatible with JS in node.js.  Then, I want to make a video about it. WIP is [here](https://github.com/guitarvydas/eh/tree/master)  If interested, see doc/ subdirectory, use Obsidian and start at "@@@ Start Here".  

2. [[2022-09-19-Project Collaboration Jams]] my thoughts (intention?) to create a Discord to re-jam the "Cube Cat" game.  Hoping to attract FBP'ers and others to collaborate and make tools for building simple games.

3. [[2022-09-20-Bloatware Caused By Type-Checking]]  My thoughts keep swirling around the issue of bloatware.  I used to think it was related to concurrency.  Now, I think that it is related to 0D and The State Explosion Problem (concurrency is just a side issue caught up in this mess, and becomes easy if you deal with 0D and State Explosion first).  This article contains alpha-thoughts on the issue of Bloatware.

4. I think that I should write a "book" about "What I Learned in the Programming Trenches".  I've outlined The Big 3 and hope to flesh it out some more...
		1. 0D
		2. Macros
		3. Bloatware

5. I am playing with Discord Storyboard, hoping to do a video about 
	- how to avoid using *if-then-else* (https://github.com/guitarvydas/avoidif)
	- parsing explorer (https://github.com/guitarvydas/parsingexplorer)
	- ė (pronounced "eh" in ASCII, see (1) above)
	- verbatim (PEG allows nesting code snippets, which allows incremental transpilation, instead of one-big-swoop-compilation) (https://github.com/guitarvydas/verbatim)

6. Major breakthrough re. simplification of git: multigit and subrepos. (https://github.com/guitarvydas/verbatim).  I began to use multigit in ė (1, above).  I always thought that git should be simpler, but couldn't put my finger on it.  Multigit is more along these lines.  Git is good for managing existing code, but not so good for developing new ideas/code.  Multigit makes it much easier to create multiple projects that re-use other projects that are still being developed.

7. Overcame silliness: How to emit Python code (indenter included in ė project above ("eh" in ASCII)).  Emit pseudo-Python, bracketed.  Then, run the indenter to delete the bracketing and create Python-compatible indentation. Only a few lines of JS, but removes a whole lot of complication which would otherwise be encountered.  Thinking of Ohm-based Verbatim allows one to invent this simple tool (they're not directly related, but the ideas feed off of each other ("brainstorming") - notation affects thinking and determines what is thinkable (e.g. thinking only in the FP paradigm would not have led me to this simple invention)).

A year ago, I wrote several blogs each morning out of fear of not waking up the next day.  Now, instead, I am writing and programming every day, but not publishing as often.  When I get "front 1" (above) wrapped up, I might take a breather and revisit things I've written and not published.  Or, I might choose to video a bunch of shorts using Descript.  My books "Takeaways" (which is a collection of the takeaways blogs that you have already read) and "Hamburger Workbench" (about parsing) are waiting for me to dust off and publish.  I like writing in Obsidian, but Leanpub is not compatible with that format.  I was writing and debugging some simple scripts - using 0D diagrams - but got waylaid working on ė.  Maybe when golf season ends, I will get serious about publishing this stuff.  Maybe.
