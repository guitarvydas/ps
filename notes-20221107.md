Micro Syntax <== Ohm-JS.  

Ohm is a Child of PEG.  IMO PEG is about Parser Theory instead of Language Theory. PEG allows thought patterns that are strictly verbotten by Language Theory, e.g. nesting, phrases, identifiers containing whitespace, etc. (which lead to off-the-wall thoughts like gradual code transpilation ("verbatims"), multiple identifiers for the same slot, etc.)...

IMO...

The word "computer" needs to be re-purposed to mean a conglomeration of 1,000 rPis (Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, cores, etc.) to address the needs of robotics, IoT, internet, blockchain, etc., etc.

The rPis are arranged in a strict, loosely-coupled hierarchical manner communicating via Structured Message Passing (layered message passing, Up, Down, Across, Through, using queues instead of stacks).  [Aside: The rPis are NOT arranged in a tightly-coupled graph].

Each rPi runs single-threaded software written in something like Haskell, Python, C, etc. Eschewing Linux, et al.

Each rPi merrily does its own thing at its own speed and passes commands/results down and up a tree in a big business, Org-Chart -like manner.

A not-yet-existing programming language ties all of this activity together (I look at /bin/sh, FBP, StateCharts, whiteboarding, etc. for inspiration).

(My various experiments include:  Ä—, Py0D https://github.com/guitarvydas/{eh,py0d}.)

An interesting challenge for me (if this doesn't make sense, it's my fault :-, please tell me)...

Any programming language that uses functions is based on the 1950's notion of 1-CPU. And, is doomed to fail in 2022+, IMO :-).

We've way-over-stretched the 1950's notion of "function". We CAN express concurrency with over-stretched-functions, but the result isn't as clear as it might be. The result is, also, more brittle than necessary.

Normal people are used to dealing with independent objects that contain no implicit dependencies.  Programmers have this normality beaten out of them through schooling and resort to more-unnatural clockwork-code.  Programmers use the derogatory term "concurrency" to mean normality.

Achieving independent code objects is really, really easy, but not obvious due to our 1950s indoctrination.  Simply use queues instead of stacks.  Not exactly rocket science.

Our indoctrination says that the syntax 'f(x)' means "call function f, and block until a result is returned".  We need a new syntax (or to re-purpose this one) to mean "send x to my output called 'f', and don't wait for a result, my parent will figure out what my output 'f' is connected to and will cause 'x' to be delivered to it sometime in the future.  You CAN express clockwork-ness in this style [where every node runs at its own speed]. We use the name "protocol" to mean this.

I strongly believe that we need to build software in layers and use programming languages/IDEs/Diagrams that express layers.  Instead, we use programming languages that crush everything down to a single layer - a bunch of functions.  If you think of layers using function syntax, you get - more functions.  We saw this problem manifest itself in the PLFA book. They had to keep inventing new "function" names for the various layers that they wanted to talk about (and, resorted to using Unicode for this, and, to Currying, etc. Too bad that Emacs gave them the ability to do so :-).

"small set of orthogonal primitives": 

fyi: Primitives that are +internally+ orthogonal: NS16032 and PDP11 assembler, gcc (RTL), Cordy's Orthogonal Code Generator. In 2022, OPL (Orthogonal Programming Languages) == 1. Ohm for operations + 2. OOP Objects for operands of those operations.
