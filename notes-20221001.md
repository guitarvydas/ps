Suggestions sought: I would like to find "the simplest" workflow for producing video shorts on technical, computer programming issues.  It seems that I am making slideshows.  ATM, I like Apple Keynote (similar to Powerpoint) for editing slides (close second: Obsidian Advanced Slides) for visuals and I like "Just Press Record" on my iPhone for audio.  I did not succeed in marrying the pure audio with a video of all of the slides (with nonesense audio like "one, two, three, four, ...") (.mov).  I ended up carving the audio file (.m4a) up into scenes and then dropped still screenshots of each slide (14 .pngs) onto the scenes.  Could I have done something more simply? (I tried recording screencasts on my Mac, but found that I froze and sounded unnatural. I copy/pasted the transcript from the 1st take, then simply read it, recording a 2nd take.  I want to marry that 2nd reading (basically a long punch-in) with the video of the screencast (deleting the audio from the screencast).  This sounds do-able in Descript, maybe I need to futz (ffmpeg) with the format output by my iPhone.  Or, maybe I need to change my approach).


I've recorded an audio punch-in on my iPhone and want to drop it onto a video scene, deleting the original audio associated with the scene, keeping the video.  (What I really want is "the simplest" workflow for quickly recording video shorts on technical, software issues by using video from a screencast and pure audio from my iPhone ("Just Press Record" -> .m4a)).  I'm new to this and haven't figured out how to do this. I am willing to change my workflow, if that makes it easier.  Hopefully, I'm missing something obvious. (The mic button/audio-only doesn't seem to record anything). Suggestions welcome...

Actually, at this moment my favourite toolset is: Ohm-JS + tree-oriented-assembler (e.g. Lisp, but forcing myself to use Python and JS).  Lisp-macro-thinking results in more freedom than formal language theory, and wildly different ways of looking at the problem, for example nested matching enabled by PEG.  Nesting => verbatim (gradual code generation).  I'm currently working on recursive layered software "languages", "ė" which is devolving into "pytalk" and changes on a daily basis (I'd be happy to share and would be happy to have collaborators).

... currently attempting to explain DaS (diagrams as syntax ; not code->diagrams, but diagrams->code).  ė transpiles "hello world" from .drawio to JSON, then Python and CL (using Draw.io + Ohm-JS + JS + PROLOG + HTML) ...
