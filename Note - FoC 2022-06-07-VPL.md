a) I build DaS (Diagrams as Syntax) languages using Ohm-JS + SWIPL (PROLOG). If I liked writing nested-loops and exhaustive search, I would skip PROLOG and just use JS/Python/whatever.

b) I have very strong opinions about VPLs.  #1 is that I stay away from VPLs and go for the middle road - a hybrid of text+diagrams+overlapping (anti-grid-based languages, like just about all text-based languages).  SVG seems to have more than what is needed (rects, ellipses, lines, text, (x,y)).  #2 is that you need to think 0D+Simultaneity (AKA Concurrency (0D == zero dependency)) to draw sensible diagrams of programs.

c) No, I don't know of any IDE that makes VPL construction uncomplicated enough to use.  I roll my own.
