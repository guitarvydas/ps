OO and FP succeed in describing data construction and functions.

OO and FP fail in describing sequencing, history, control flow, etc.

When you strip FP down to its roots[^sl], you see *why*.  FP was never intended to sequence operation, it was intended only to evaluate data as mathematical functions.

[^sl]: McCarthy's original Lisp is best exemplified by modern Sector Lisp.  In fact, Tunney created a GC algorithm which is cleaner than McCarthy's original GC.
