This is not (directly) FBP.  I post it here since it might pose an interesting challenge to FBPers and might help in popularizing FBP and FBP-like ideas.
I think that we need "project collaboration jams" and summarize my random thoughts here: https://publish.obsidian.md/programmingsimplicity/2022-09-19-Project+Collaboration+Jams.
Suggested goal: to create Discords on a per-*project* basis.  A project is created by a team of domain experts, where the various domains needed for the project are very different from one another.
I intended to create a Discord server for this, but never got around to it.
Discussion encouraged.
