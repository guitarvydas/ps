riffing on [Jack Rusher's excellent points about convenient debugging](https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1558000856263540736):
- The main feature being used is "Lisp Restart" https://gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html
- "Restart" is more than class-based error conditions.
- Lisp Restart is a form of hot-loading.
- Restarts were invented in Lisp, I am unaware of this level of power being available for most other languages.
- The concept of restarts seems to have languished and does not appear in modern languages, like JavaScript, Python, Haskell, Rust, etc.
- The Lisp Restarts UX  leaves something to be desired.  There is no overriding design principle to the UX.  Sometimes "abort" is triggered by hitting "3" and sometimes "abort" is triggered by some othe keystroke.
- Restarts are technically harder when the main communications mechanism is LIFO (AKA call-stack, functions).
- UNIX shell pipelines use FIFOs as the main communications mechanism.  "Restarts" can be much cheaper using FIFOs. Kill a process, replace it with another process with exactly the same FDs for stdin, stdout and stderr.
- ALL languages are interpreted.  Compilers are optimizations of the runtimes.  Compilers run some of the interpretation at "compile-time" and off-load work from the runtimes.
- Tailoring / revamping a language to appease compilation is premature optimization.  You trade expressitivity for optimization. You lose the ability to "think" more freely when you insist on using a language which appeases compilation.
- Hot-loading is a feature of the *runtime*.
- Lisp (and other so-called "dynamic" languages) have the feature that the runtime language is the SAME as the programming language.  Most "compiled languages" don't have this feature, for example, when you program in C and debug in GDB, you have to learn 2 languages, C and GDB's command language, whereas with Lisp, the command language of the debugger IS Lisp.  When there is a separate language for the debugger, that language is often stunted and lags behind the capabilities of the programming language.  For example, VSCode allows one to examine Objects, but one has to switch to a language of mouse-clicks to dig into Objects instead of using language-level expressions like `x.y.z`.  It is now 2022 and debuggers have been getting better, but, dynamic languages (like Lisp) had this level of restrospection right out of the box in the mid-1900s.  With modern languages it is easily possible to insert *print* statements to view data, but, when debugging you want to examine data on-the-fly and you might not have anticipated which data needs to be examined.  Inserting *print* statements into the code before a run is called "printf debugging", which is generally a poor UX for understanding Design bugs.
- The apparent integration of a programming language and debugging environment is enhanced by using the same command language.  When the programming language and the debugging environment use the same language, it *appears* that the IDE is more-integrated.
- Internally, the Lisp REPL calls Eval(), then punts to the runtime.  Hot-loading is implemented by the Lisp runtime, not Eval().  Hot-loading *could* be separated from the language IDE, but usually isn't.
- A "compiler" is simply Eval().  For example, imagine adding two integers, `a` and `b` together.  Eval() checks that `a` is an integer and checks that `b` is an integer then calls `AddInteger(a,b)`.  Using divide-and-conquer, we can snap the checking code away from Eval() and shove it into code that runs earlier.  I.E. the compiler runs functions `ensureInteger (a)` and `ensureInteger (b)`, then leaves instructions around for the runtime that say `AddIntegerButDontBotherCheckingSinceItIsGuaranteedThatTheOperandsAreIntegers (a, b)`
- line vs. tree oriented assembler
	- Lisp is tree-oriented Assembler
	- ASM is line-oriented Assembler.
	- property: no syntax to get in the way => easy to plumb units together
	- property: expression language, every operation returns a value (without needing explicit syntax), => easy to plumb units together
- Lisp syntax (or, lack of syntax) makes it easy to plug components together, and, makes it easier to imagine / invent hot-loading.  In many ways, compiler-appeasement languages look to ideas from use-cases using dynamic languages and show how to optimize these ideas.
- Sometimes, type-checkers slow down the process of Design.  You encode your first guess in a type system, then, you feel reluctant to change the Design (the Type System) as new revelations about the problem-space are encountered.
- One needs a Big Red Button, during Design, that wipes out everything done up to that point and lets you start from scratch (preserving hard-won knowledge).  Lisp and dynamic languages do this better than compiler-appeasement languages.  There is less friction in rewriting a Lisp program from scratch than for rewriting a carefully-crafted program containing a carefully-crafted type system (usually wrong) and premature optimizations.  [FYI - carefully-crafted Type Systems are usually wrong during Design, since, once you get it right (or "good enough"), you stop working on it and ship it.  The majority of programmers only continue working on a Design if it is insufficient / buggy in some way].
- - The Lispworks debugger is better than Slime.  Lispworks has more thought put into the UX and better-integration of the GUI tools.  Common Lisp has access to various features built into the language, but access by itself is not good enough, else we'd be using Assembler instead of HLLs.
