The goal of programming is to control a machine.

To do this, programmers use tools, often called IDEs (Integrated Development Systems).

Programming languages are primitive IDEs.

Programming languages were invented in the mid-1900s when all we had was weak hardware, keyboards, TTYs (sometimes), no graphics, etc., etc.

Things have changed.

CPUs are much, much faster.

Memory is much, much cheaper and abundant.

Programmers have developed UXs and IDEs for non-programmers, e.g. spreadsheets, word processors, etc., but have not upgraded their own tools much.

Programmers build IDEs as programming languages based on the crufty notion of grids of non-overlapping, small bitmaps, i.e. characters of text.

We now have machines that can draw overlapping things in 2D, and, we have SVG (which contains the basics - (1) rectangles (2) ellipses (3) lines (4) text).

Yet, we continue to build programmer IDEs using primitive textual programming languages.
