# Benfits of ė
- anti-bloatware
	- a major source of bloat is special-case code needed to handle out-of-sweet-spot use-cases
		- for example, FP works well if mutation is prohibited
			- mutation added to any programming language that uses functions results in epicycles
				- "epicycle" ≣ "workaround"
				- e.g. "thread safety"
				- e.g. heaps and "garbage collection" for heaps
				- e.g. Mars Pathfinder disaster ("priority inversion")
- technical drawings come "for free"
- concurrency comes "for free"
- "build and forget" development
	- adding new software cannot change existing software
		- not true with state-of-the-art libraries
			- changing something "here" might cause something "over there" to operate differently
- distributed programming comes "for free"
	- blockchain
	- internet
	- robotics
	- games using [NPCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character)
- multiple-CPU paradigm
	- existing techniques are based on a single-CPU paradigm, prevalent in 1950's thinking
- ability to plug together software components to create mimimal set of functionality
	- no need for all-in-one operating systems
