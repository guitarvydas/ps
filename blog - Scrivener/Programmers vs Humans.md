# Programmers vs Normal People #


| Programmers | Normal People |
| :----- | :----- |
| abstraction | - |
| recursion | looping |
| types | Numbers, Words |
| synchrony | Concurrency[^fn1] |
| - | Org Charts, Business |


The normal people concept of Org Charts might be equated with hierarchy and divide and conquer and scaling.  In my opinion, they are not the same.  Normal people use divide and conquer much better (deeper) than programmers do.  Businesses scale, software does not[^fn2].

Programmers go to school and are taught to think in ways that are foreign to "normal people".  Most people don't understand the need for abstraction.  Systems like BASIC, spreadsheets and Hypercard were popular because people could program them immediately without being schooled in abstraction.

[^fn1]: concurrency is understood in daily life, e.g. musical chords, e.g. autonomous system (vs. consciousness), e.g. see my essay "Parallel vs. Synchronous" https://computingsimplicity.neocities.org/anecdotes/Anecdote%20-%20Secretary%20vs.%20Synchrony.pdf

[^fn2]: Hardware scales, but, programmers have not learned that lesson yet.
