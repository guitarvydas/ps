In my opinion, Ohm-JS is a breakthrough technology.

This booklet contains a *very* simple introduction to the Ohm-JS app.  

I take a silly phrase and create a piece of code from it.

This booklet shows 
- how to set up Ohm-JS
- how to parse a very simple phrase with Ohm-JS
- how to add hook[^hook] code to an Ohm-JS script.  The hook code creates output code based on the input.  


[^hook]: "Hook" is AKA[^aka] "semantics" in the Ohm-JS documentation.

[^aka]: AKA means "Also Known As"

I believe that anyone interested in delving deeper into Ohm-JS can do so by reading the Ohm-JS documentation, after getting their "feet wet" with a small workbench that just works. 

Shuhari.
