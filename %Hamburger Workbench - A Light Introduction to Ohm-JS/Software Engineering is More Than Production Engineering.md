Software Engineering is more than Production Engineering. e.g. 
- Design
- first-cut at details
- second-cut at details (gaining understanding of the problem, over-kill and including *everything*)
- third-cut at details (expunging unnecessary overkill)
- Production Engineering
- Test Engineering
- testing
- Maintenance Engineering
- maintenance, rework, regression testing
