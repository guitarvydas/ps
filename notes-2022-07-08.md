goal: to build a simple webpage in which a user can 
1. draw a draw.io diagram
2. hit a "Transpile" button
3. see Python code for the diagram (copy/paste it to a .py file?)

background:
pieces:

---
I don't know how to do this, if you do, tell me:
I want to embed draw.io diagrams in a web page, then suck their output into Javascript (and process the output using Javascript).

background: I've got a way to compile draw.io diagrams to JSON, I've got a way to compile text-based components (Leaf/Container/State-Machine) to Python.  I want to consolidate these pieces into one demo page.

easy: if this isn't easy, tell me, but don't waste time on it. I'm just trying to avoid a learning curve for me on the assumption that this is easy if you already know some background details.  What I've got mostly works on the command line, but, I want to lift this stuff into a webpage for a demo (and to continue development).

more background: git clone https://github.com/guitarvydas/pypm.git, then open pypm/tbx/index.html in a browser.  Click on "Test".  I want to replace the yellow ("old lace") windows with draw.io diagrams of the code.

more more background: I'm "testing" my diagram stuff by building a real program to copy a bunch of files (I could do this with a shell script, but I want to eat my own dogfood)

more more more background: Composability doesn't come from diagrams, it comes from 0D (zero dependencies).  If you have 0D, you get diagrams "for free".  You, also, get concurrency "for free" if you have 0D.  0D is easy to do in text programming if you know that you want it.  I see how to do 0D in Python, JS, etc.  Thinking about diagrams and concurrency backed me into 0D.

Problem: I want to build a POC IDE that compiles draw.io diagrams to Python using code that exists.

I already have most of the transpiler pieces on the command line, but, I want to integrate them all into a single demo webpage.

I don't know:
- how to embed draw.io into a webpage
- how to slurp *.drawio* output into Javascript on the same webpage.  I already have .js code that reads .drawio files from a local disk file.

This is simply a problem of mechanics.  I'm a retired ?nix guy and have built a command-line-based transpiler (I've built lots of compilers in the past.  I have turned my attention to compiling diagrams).  Now, I need to go down the learning curve and figure out how to lift this stuff into a webpage P.O.C.  The ideal, for me, would be an example of a simple .html file that views (edits?) a draw.io diagram and slurps the output into some Javascript data structure (a string, a blob of bytes?), or, better yet, someone who wants to help me do this.  I think that this might be trivial, but I am faced with a lot of unknown (for me) info and a wall of documentation, not knowing where to start reading.

If this is harder than I think, it would be useful to know that, too.  I could stop wasting time searching for anwers/info.

Problem: I want to build an IDE that compiles draw.io diagrams to Python using code that exists.

This is simply a problem of mechanics. The hard part, for me, is just putting this stuff onto a webpage.  I've already built the "easy" stuff (the diagram-to-python transpiler functions).

I don't know:
- how to embed draw.io into a webpage
- how to slurp *.drawio* output into Javascript on the same webpage.  I already have .js code that reads .drawio files from a local disk file.

I think that this is trivial, but I am missing a lot of background info on how to do this.  The ideal answer, for me, would be a .html file that does exactly this (probably about 5 lines of code?) - (1) view/edit a draw.io file, and, (2) reads the .drawio data using Javascript (into, say, a JS string).

If this is harder than I think, knowing that would allow me to stop wasting time searching for answers...

I want to eat my own dogfood and build a script, using a diagram, that creates a Python program

I would like to know:
- how to embed the draw.io editor into a webpage (or, failing that, embed diagrams created by draw.io)
- how to slurp *.drawio* output into Javascript on the same webpage.  I already have .js code that reads and groks .drawio files from a local disk file.

I think that this is trivial, but I am missing a lot of background info on how to do this.  The ideal answer, for me, would be a .html file that does exactly this (probably about 5 lines of code?) - (1) edits a draw.io diagram, and, (2) reads the .drawio data using Javascript (into, say, a JS string or a buffer).  Or, an answer saying "this is harder than you think".

(I would be happy to provide more info).
