# My Workflow

My workflow for creating infromational documents and videos is:

1. Speak the ideas to life.  Allow stumbling and thinking out loud, dragging words outs, multiple takes.
2. Use speech-to-text software to create a written form of the ideas.  The written form is "conversational" and not "formal" sounding.
3. Read the written form and record the reading.
4. Edit the recording and publish it as video, audio and textual transcription.

# Why?
I have learned to write in a very formal, non-conversational manner.

I roll ideas around in my head as I write them.

I edit my writing on-the-fly.  As I write, I go back and fix - edit - the writing.  I fix typos and I dig deeper into concepts, writing more.

The resulting writing sounds stilted and non-conversational.

## Keyboarding
Some people speak at the speed of thought.  

I can type at the speed of thought.  

I learned to use a keyboard and wield it the same way people use speech.

Seeing my words in front of me - in textual form - spurs me (1) to edit the text, and, (2) to think more deeply about the ideas.

I can edit text faster using a keyboard than in some other way.  For example, I find Apple Dictation to be too cumbersome for editing.  I can edit text more quickly when I use *emacs* or *Word*.

# Barfy and the Professor
For a while, I studied songwriting.

My favourite teacher - mentor - is Pat Pattison.

He teaches that one should write songs by:
1. dumping ideas
2. editing, later.

He calls this "Barfy and the Professor".  The Swamp Monster walks out of the lagoon onto the beach.  

The Swamp Monster barfs on the beach.  This is step (1) - dumping ideas.

Later, The Professor comes by and picks and chooses items from the pile and cleans them up.  This is step (2) - editing.

Other teachers suggest this same process, (1) write, and, (2) edit.  They describe this process as:

- "doing your homework"
- writing more than you need, then throwing much of it out

# Separating Writing Into 2 Parts - Divide and Conquer

Separating Creation from Editing makes writing easier and produces a result that is more fluid-sounding.

Tangling Creation and Editing together makes the process much more difficult.  Only a few people can work with the tangled process, implicitly untangling and dividing and conquering the process.

When you record a song, the process usually consists of 
1. laying down  - recording - individual tracks for each instrument and voice
2. mixing and editing the tracks into a finished single song which contains the unison of all of the individual tracks.
