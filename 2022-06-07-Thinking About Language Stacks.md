The ability of PEG to specify matches of balanced brackets, allows one to think about languages differently, e.g. it is possible to imagine "language stacks" and "transpilers".

Below, a simple grammar in Ohm-JS that skips over anything that isn't a brace bracket...

```
main = matched main?
matched =
  | "{" main "}" -- nested
  | anythingelse -- bottom
anythingelse = ~"{" ~"}" any
```
