The point of a textual programming language is to provide an IDE to programmers based on grids of non-overlapping, small bitmaps (AKA "characters") using ASCII Art (e.g. "{...}").

The point of a diagrammatic programming language is to provide an IDE to programmers based on diagrams.  Where diagram elements can overlap and change size and have no implicit ordering.

If you use a DPL, but, have to look "inside" a component to see what's going on, then the DPL fails to provide a diagram-based IDE.

Specifically: node-red does not show the full component input API on the diagram, you have to look at the underlying code, hence, I would not classify node-red as a DPL (nor a VPL).    Node-red uses a textual namespace (JS-style) instead of a visual namespace.

Node and wire is "the way", but node-red does not qualify.

Furthermore, the last time I looked, the assumption of a single input was hard-wired into and sprayed throughout the node-red editor code.

There's a whole can of worms that violates what-I-call 0D (zero dependency).  Example: a component must not hard-wire the name of another component into its code.  The easiest way to handle this problem is to create 2 classes of components - (1) Leaves and (2) Containers.  Maybe node-red gets this right - does node-red have the concept of coordination layers?  Surely, node-red has 1 layer for coordination, but is this recursive?  A coordination layer should compose other components, regardless if they are Leaves or Containers.

You don't need to parse artwork to have a DPL, for example, construction blueprints are diagrams in which certain syntactic rules are followed, but, are not full-blown pieces of artwork.  Likewise, text-based programming IDEs (commonly called Programming Languages) use syntactic rules that are but a subset of full-blown prose.
