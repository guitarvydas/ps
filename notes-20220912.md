Hi Ron,

FYI, I would like to share a recent revelation regarding a GIGO that has been hounding me for decades, in case it helps someone:

The center of my swing is the top of my head, not the center of my chest.

Intellectually, I’ve known that I should swing around my spine, but deep-down-inside I want to swing around the vampire spike through my chest (Windmill, Ferris Wheel).  I haven't figured out (yet) how to supplant the incorrect image with the correct one, and, I still have to think about it (which ain't good).

background:

I’m in Toronto.  I heard your interview on GolfSmarter and bought your video.  I’m 67.  I started golfing in 1998 and don’t consider myself to be very athletic.  Johnny Winter’s opening chords to Jumpin’ Jack Flash (Winter And Live) instantly converted me into a wannabe guitarist instead of a wannabe bassist (which was my default, since McCartney has the same first name as me).  I have a ’59 strat (due to Hendrix), a D35 and an 0-16NY (Jethro Tull Thick As A Brick and Aqualung).

Compilers are just ad-hoc macro expanders.

Lisp macro expanders work only on trees (also known as lists).

Compilers are macro expanders that work on characters.

These slides show CLANG at 2,000,000 LOC and JonesForth at 1,490 LOC.

Sector Lisp is <512 bytes [sic].

This is very good evidence that "formal methods" create bloatware.

Time to re-think our priorities.

Skip learning about traditional "compiler technology" and jump to Ohm-JS / PEG.

Macros were invented in pre-CL lisp, which contained FEXPRs.  Optimizing FEXPRs out of existence has not resulted in better programmability of computers.  Maybe Mathematical Science was advanced, but, not Computer Science.  Would macros even exist if we didn't have pre-CL lisp?  We don't use technical diagrams for programming because we've been indoctrinated to think in terms of text-only "languages for programming" and to accept that bloatware is OK.

Advances, such as PEG and, now, Ohm-JS, blow over-formalized "compiler technology" out of the water.

These slides show that Clang clocks in at 2,000,000 LOC and JonesForth clocks in at 1,490 LOC.

This is evidence that something is rotten and that our programming techniques create bloatware.

Macros were invented in pre-CL lisp, which contained FEXPRs.  

Has optimizing FEXPRs out of existence resulted in better programmability of computers?  Maybe Mathematical Science has advanced, but, has Computer Science advanced?  

Is a program written using Clang that much better than one written in Sector Lisp?  3,900:1 better?

Is it worth 2MLOC of code to check for gotchas during development and faster speed in production apps?

Would lisp-like macros have been invented if we didn't have pre-CL lisp?  

We've been indoctrinated to believe that "languages for programming" must be textual and we've been indoctrinated to accept that creating bloatware is OK.

Time to re-think.

I suggest: skip learning about traditional compiler technology and jump to Ohm-JS / PEG.
