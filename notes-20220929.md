Tangential: Parsing the transcribed text would be a way to add programming actions to the text.  Maybe /bin/audio-sh?  My favourite parsing technology, ATM, is Ohm-JS.  Descript.com sells an audio/video editing/mixing-board tool based on textual editing (like, say, Logic, GarageBand, iMovie, Da Vinci Resolve, etc., but text-document-based).  One could write a quickie parser that transpiles specific text phrases to /bin/bash scripts (or Python, or, ...).

observation: Title text disappears if you double-click on the title, hit END, type a character.  I can probably work-around this using the timeline.  But, I see this as a script-GUI issue, not a functionality issue.  I'm using keystrokes that I learned for text editors, but I'm getting surprising results.

observation: I transcribed a bunch of audio.  I added a title to the only scene.  I, then, added many scenes ("\n" and "/") and chopped up the rest of the audio.  I edited the title on the last scene and that changed the title at the top, too.  GUI-wise, I was expecting that every "/" to create a clone, but "/" appears to have created references and shared all subsequent scene titles with only the one title.  Again, I can probably fix this by working on the timeline, I see this as a GUI issue in the script editor.  (Or, maybe, I expected copy-on-write).

Yes, please process a refund and gift card for me.

(I apologize that I didn't get back to this earlier (funeral and other issues)).
