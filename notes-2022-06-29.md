    It still seems like in a syntactic rule, Ohm only inserts the `spaces` rule between other rules when a space is present, which renders `spaces := space+` useless (edited)

What I see makes total sense to me, we must be talking at cross-purposes.

I don't know how to answer your question/concern, so let me try to describe what I see, in case that helps...

The grammar is in the top-left box "Test { ... }".

The test case is `FOOBAR BAZ` and is shown in the top-right box.  If you click on the thumb icon, it goes from up to down (green to red).

The test case contains 10 letters: `F`, `O`, `O`, `B`, `A`, `R`, ` ` , `B`, `A`, `Z`.  One of the letters is a space (between `R` and `B`).

The 3rd window (middle) is 1 line high and contains the letters that are being parsed.

The 4th window (bottom) is a representation of what Ohm-JS *saw* in the test case.  Ohm did not insert any characters (i.e. Ohm did not "insert" a space, you inserted one space in the 2nd test case).

If you turn-off "show spaces", the parse (4th window) becomes "FOO" "BAR" "BAZ", which represents the input to the rule "Rule".  The original test case `FOOBAR BAZ`, has its spaces stripped and becomes `FOOBARBAZ`.  Then, after the spaces are stripped, the rule "Rule" is applied and it matches.  It says that there must be a string "FOO" followed by a string "BAR" followed by a string "BAZ", and, that is exactly what is there (after spaces have been stripped).

Look at the top-most gray boxes in the 4th window.  It says that Ohm-JS parsed this as "Rule" followed by "End".   And, it shows that "Rule" breaks down into 3 matches "FOO" "BAR" "BAZ".  That is exactly what the syntactic rule "Rule" specifies (in the 1st box).

A different way to say this: The 1st (upper-left) box contains a specification of a pattern match.  The 2nd box (upper-right) contains test cases that YOU typed in.  The 3rd and 4th boxes try to show you a break-down of how the pattern-matching worked out against the spec in box 1.

You should NOT need to redefine "spaces", e.g. "spaces := ..." is dangerous and you rarely need to resort to doing this.  "Spaces" is a pattern-matching rule.  You CAN re-write the whole specification using lexical patterns - they are just more verbose than syntactic pattern-matching rules.

I've screenshotted my attempt at re-writing the grammar as a purely lexical rule.  I use "ws" instead of "spaces" to be extra-explicit.  Note that the 4th window says that it found "blank" in only 1 place - between "BAR" and "BAZ".  It tried to match a "ws" before "FOO" and between "FOO" and "BAR" and didn't find any matches.  The Kleene-star operator `*` means "match zero or more of" and the "ws" rule passes having found zero blanks.

If you want to check your understanding, replace "ws" with "spaces" everywhere in the first rule (and, you can delete the rules "ws" and "blank", if you wish).

Note that the library rule "spaces" appears in the first box at the bottom (grayed out).  If you redefine it, it still appears at the bottom, to remind you what it used to be (that's not quite correct, but we don't need to go there).
