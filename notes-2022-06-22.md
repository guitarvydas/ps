The LEGO block image is misleading.  You can't use a CALL/RETURN language to build pluggable software components unless you go to extreme lengths.  Any language that provides functions and function calling falls into the category of CALL/RETURN language, IMO.  The only non-CALL/RETURN language(s) I've encountered are Relational languages (PROLOG, etc.).  

Pluggable Components need non-synchronization.  Unwanted synchronization produces dependencies.  Dependencies produce non-pluggable components (libraries, functions) unless extreme measures are employed (e.g. threads and multi-tasking => bloatware).

Current PLs produce "LEGO blocks" where each block has been loosely sewn to every other block with a very fine thread.

Functions are state machines (one of the states is: "blocked, waiting for a result from the callee").

I'm thinking about 0D (zero-dependency).  I used to call this "concurrency" and, before that, "parallelism", but, it goes deeper than that.  I have reached the conclusion that building 0D components is trivially easy, if you focus on 0D-ness.  If you have 0D, you get technical-diagrams and concurrency "for free".

ATM, the most common way of achieving 0D is to use bloatware, commonly called Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.  

Concurrency should be O(10 bytes), but isn't.
1. Loop: 
2. poll inputs
3. poll continuation predicate, exit if need-to-terminate
4. process
5. GOTO Loop.

The LEGO block image is misleading.  You can't have LEGO blocks using any language that supports function-calling, w/o resorting to extreme measures.
