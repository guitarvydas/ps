requirements:
- compose components
- many paradigms
- many syntaxes

### Composition
- zero (0)-dependency components
	- [[@zero-dependency components]]


[[@Paradigms]]
[[@Syntaxes]]

### Syntaxes
- wrap any number of syntaxes over a paradigm
- I like Ohm-JS, which is better than PEG, which is better than REGEX
- wrap syntax over "assembler" primitives provided by toolbox language(s) 
- syntax is cheap
- give programmers a bowl of syntaxes for every paradigm
- programmers compose many paradigms to solve one problem
- it used to be difficult to build programming languages, but this is easy today (Ohm-JS, transpile to other existing languages, transpile to LLVM, transpile to WASM)
