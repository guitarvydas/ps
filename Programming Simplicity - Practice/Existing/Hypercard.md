# Hypercard

Hypercard was an Apple Mac application that many people loved.

Hypercard provided access to atomic actions, such as GUI building.

Hypercard used a card stack metaphor, where users could place programmable items on cards.  Some programmable items could refer to other cards in a manner equivalent to subroutines.

Hypercard encouraged hyperlinking before the world-wide web became popular.  Hypercard supported hyperlinking between cards on the same machine.

Hypercard provided different levels of access to features (5 levels) depending on users' skills.  At the simplest level, a card stack could only be used and not modified.  At the deepest level, power users could create and program new cards and stacks.
