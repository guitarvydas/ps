I'm beginning to go down the learning curve of js2py in hopes of calling Ohm-JS from Python.  Anyone: please cut me off at the pass if this is a dead end or if there is a better way.

> Does anybody know if there’s a parser generator like tree-sitter, i.e. produces a CST instead of an AST, but that can be used as a compiler frontend? Tree-sitter kinda can be, but it’s not the easiest

Maybe Ohm-Editor (Ohm-JS)?

FYI - it was already practical to build operating systems and processes, in 1956, using Lisp Lambda (a concept which was later complexified and named Closures).  Systems people, strongly biased by the 1950s single-CPU mentality and the need to preserve CPU cycles and to conserve memory and to reuse memory (mutation and heap GC, resp.) had an allergy to Lisp and decided to invoke Greenspun's 10th Rule to build ad-hoc closures in Assembler and C that used FIFOs instead of LIFOs (queues vs. stacks, resp.).  This ad-hoc code was replete with epicycles like preemption, semaphores, etc., and caused gotchas evident in the likes of the Mars Pathfinder disaster.

I think that we are due for a Great Reset in programming.  Concepts like FBP, MVM, StateCharts, Sector Lisp, SVG, etc., are canaries in the coal mines.

AI is yet another HCI component.  I guess that keyboards and glass teletypes looked as miraculous in the 1950s as AI looks today.
