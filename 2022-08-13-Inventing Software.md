| concept | invented in | Kind | popularized in | Comment |
|----------|------------|-----|-----|-----------|
| garbage collection | Lisp, Smalltalk | Dynamic Language|Java| Sector Lisp's GC is cleaner (more FP-ish) than McCarthy's GC
| FP | McCarthy's Lisp (1.5) | Dynamic Language | modern PLs | butchered in modern languages like Python, Rust, etc. (see [Sector Lisp](https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/) for an example of pure FP)
|  REPL | Lisp | Dynamic Language ||
| call stack | recursive, mathematics-based languages |Static Language| the call stack did not exist in early CPUs like IBM360 (see BAL instruction)
| thread safety | | | 
| preemption |  | | |
| heap | | |
| REPL | Lisp | Dynamic Language |
| functions | clay tablets, paper | Static Language | blocking protocol (caller blocks waiting for callee to return result) |
| Operating Systems | wrap lambdas with FIFOs | clumsy, manual implementations of Closures |
| Orthogonal Code Generation | Cordy, GCC |  GCC uses RTL invented by Fraser/Davidson (subclass of OCG) |
| lambdas | Lisp | | anonymous functions |
| Data Descriptors | Holt | normalization | |
| OO | Simula, Smalltalk, popularized by Java |
| Prototype Inheritance | Self, popularized by JavaScript | |
| Classes | Smalltalk, popularized by Java | optimization of Prototype Inheritance |
| recursive functions | ALGOL, popularized by Lisp, Pascal, C | based on single CPU model (LIFO call stack)
| Loop | non-starter for Distributed Computing | |
