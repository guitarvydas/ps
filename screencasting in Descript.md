The next thing I'm going to try is to "flip" my approach.  Maybe my thinking is backwards.  I've been trying to preserve the first cut of the video and then paste new audio into it.

It is easy to slap "B-roll" video onto scenes in the script.

So, instead of trying to preserve my first cut of the screencast, I will try to "snip" the first cut into pieces and drop the pieces into scenes of the new audio.  I think that I will be able to silence the first cut by, either, detaching the audio and deleting it, or, by lowering the gain on the first cut (down to "nothing").

So, I intend to try: (1) compose my script using a video+audio recording of my screencast, then editing the transcribed text (using my favourite editor), then (2) pasting the edited text into a new composition, then (3) creating scenes in the new text and dropping bits of the first-cut screencast into the scenes.  (This is probably easier than it looks when the steps are written out as above...)

I did something almost like this in my most recent attempt.  I glued "new" script text into a composition then had the Stock Voice Henry read it (it did a very good job).  I then dropped around 20+ video clips from the media center into scenes in the new script.  I +think+ that if I treat the first-cut video clips in the same way I used stock "media", it should be easy to do what I want ...

Yeah, yesterday's conversation with Micah was very helpful - it got me thinking again and asking myself why I am bothering to force my original workflow onto this.  I, also, watched some of Marcello's "office hours" from yesterday and he showed something I wasn't fully unaware of - deleting a bunch of audio in a range, while preserving the whole piece and preserving the timing.

I'm used to the idea of inventing new ways to use tools to save me time.  I used LogicPro a lot, and, to me, Descript seems like it's going to give me a 10x improvement.  OTOH, I might need to un-learn some of my habits learned using timeline editors like LogicPro.
