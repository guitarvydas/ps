I have begun trying the Leanpub workflow (publish unfinished books).  Comments welcome.

I have no idea, yet, how to price these...

Apparently, each book has its own discussion forum.  I haven't explored this yet.

Please don't share these coupons...

"Parallelism" contains the beginnings of a short discussion of 0D.  0D is a pivotal concept.

thanks

ps. I have many other books in wings, but am waiting until I get my feet wet with the above two.
