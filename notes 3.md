Butchering the English Language

I would say that ??? and ??? are NOT great songs.

They might be some of Pink Floyd's best, but, the songs have niggly problems that make them less-great as songs.

These songs butcher the English language.

I hear mis-set lyrics, similar to how one hears 9ths and 11ths and inversions in music and melodies. I hear how lyrics are draped over melodies and how they fit with the underlying music.

From this perspective, the line "Hello anybody IN here?" is mis-set.  The melody at "in" is important, but the word "in" is not important.  There is a mis-match.  No natural English speaker says "hello, anybody IN here?".  The emPHAsis is on the wrong sylLAble.

Likewise, "no dark sarcasm" is not pronounced "no dark sarCHASM".

These might be subtle points, but our brain hears these details and our brain senses that something is wrong.  These subtle mistakes detract - subconsciously - from the songs and makes them imperfect in some je-nais-se-quoi way.
