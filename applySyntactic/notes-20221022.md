Hi Patrick.  I occasionally see your tweets and am thinking that you are interested in VPL technology.  I try to restrict myself to Ohm-JS discussions here, but, my main thrust is building diagram compilers, and, trying to figure out how to communicate these ideas. N.B. "compiling" not "modelling".   If this interests you, I would be glad to share and discuss.
