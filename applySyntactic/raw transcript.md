Processing macros using OMG yes supply syntactic oh we oh I'm concentrating on our class on a piece of an app which is a get a dungeon like game called ghost stars it's on edge that I/O part of a game jam the script has commands in it and lumps of tasks that need to be shown when each room is crossed into the grammar for this begins with a lowercase text equals one or more macro invocations the lower case of significant in them JS it means don't skip spaces that's like standard pig if you look at my rule for macro I call a place in tactic 2455 times in five different cases to parse five different phrases each phrase I want to skip spaces and use the convenience of OMG ass so I i want to say show some thing at some coordinate if you look at your phrase down there move phrases similar it's move some of jeep with some PNG file to a coordinate over sometime or a time span there's a wheat phrase in this particular case the designer wanted to wait in terms double number of frames and then there's a fade the black phrase which just says feed the black over sometime a time spam there's a jump phrase that says jump to a chapter specifically named so what the macro does is it tries show phrase move phrase weight phrase fade the black face jump a phrase in that order if it doesn't find those than a tries Lex_spoken intros. It's Ray's separate or tries and i'll new lines and if nothing nothing up there matches in that order then it just accepts the next character owns and for what it is and doesn't do anything to it the interesting part of a place in tactic is that OMG yes mason of a pig makes you a personal expression grammars insist that you insert all the space matching needed for a phrase MGS tries to clean that up make it and skips spaces and insignificant bits of syntactic sugar in OMG as if you use a capital letter for the rule name you will get the functionality of skipping spaces so let's look at shall phrase so show phrase says show any number of spaces parisotto file name them any number of spaces than parse out the the word AT art than any number of spaces then parasol a capital coordinate thing and if you look down in the grammar the definitions of file Liam and coordinate are down there so file name is just a name and if you keep looking further down you'll see how her name is defined the name is it a standard of programming language type of thing that doesn't allow spaces inside of it has the start with the letter and then I can have letters or digits or other in this case underscores and colons as part of the next letter next characters after the first character recorded it is a number with a little acts followed by another number and there can be any number of spaces in between the number between the numbers and the X before and after the numbers before the numbers after the matches only as much as it needs to match and then stopped
