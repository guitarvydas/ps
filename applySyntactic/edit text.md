We look at the grammar for show phrase we look om editor the grammar in the Om and adore for show phrase look around half way down on the left-hand side you'll see the rule call show phrase in that rule matches if there is a literal word show with a capital S I think all the file name other literal word at a phone call to coordinate with a C I have followed by a literal. The other coat around that will show you how those things parcelled a file name is just a name in the name i name is a L a letter followed by a more letters or digits or underscores or colons in this particular case according it is a number X and a number and because there's a c in the name of the rule spaces are skipped so it could be number space x space number will match we could put a number

Number number stuff like that the other interesting rule to look that is text which is the second rule down and it has two legs each Lego tag with a – – the first leg is called macro and the second leg is called ignore Ohm-JS parses or tries the legs tries to match the legs in the order that they appear so when I get a piece of text it's pointing at a character and then tries to apply to syntactic rule called micro with a capital M which breaks down into the rules show freeze we in larger examples or larger production code we might add more legs the macro rule but in this example I will need got one leg unless the show for his leg so if it matches the show phrase it eats and if it doesn't match and it drops down to the next leg which says take any character and the macro and the – – macaron – – ignore tags they don't do anything they will be used later in the semantics processing and if we look at the far right hand side window we see a test of square test the text and you'll see there's an a space B space E
Than the phrase show prologue_BG space at space 0X -550 dodge
D E F probably a new liner so I can't tell from the way it's displayed at the moment and at the very bottom is the parse tree of the grammar applied to that input and Wilson and you see that the parse tree says the A was matched as text Dash ignore the space after the AA is mash those text also the beer smash this text and so on and then finally hits the middle of the well that hits the second line in the second line passes out as show prologue of where the new line has been eaten by the space skipping rule over because she'll praise is written in capitals it has a capital letter at the front and macro has a capital letter at the front you'll see that the space after show has been removed also and then it goes through does the file name the ex oh no the file i am at is there without spaces and then coordinate in capitals it was matched out as a number X another number with a minus sign in front of it and then we drop back into parsing things that don't match the phrase and we can DEF with the spaces in between if we don't look the parsing explorer we see the first box contains the source code the second box contains the grammar bird box contains the rewriting or a rule that I've called the fabricator and then the fourth box at the bottom which is white is the open of the fabricator so the person explorer uses jesus applies the grammar against the input source if that all matches then it calls rule by rule the fabricator and if you look closely at the fabricator it's written to produce strings a string of final string that looks like a piece of Jason and in in producing the string the fabricator basically has rules that have to match one to one with the rules in the grammar oops i want

If you look at the third box which contains the code for the fabricator you'll see that it consists of a bunch the rules that match one to one with the rules and the grammar the rule name let's pick on the first one SRC is followed by a perimeter list text plus which matches the text plus of the grammar than an equal sign and then a string the limited by an open "and close by" the string builder but that's a string builder for a phrase it can contain literal characters or can contain references to parameters the references the parameters are the little double angle bracket of double angle brackets so in the first in the first rule basically the string that's fabricated is backslash and which is a 
Open brace space on enters space: space and then it refers to the text explain the recursive call will refers to the result of the text parameter how much is an iterator in this case so big the engine does a walk here tree walk for you oh and returns a single stream that single stream gets stuffed in where the angle brackets text is and then is followed by a } followed by another
Followed by the" the interesting part is the show phrase rule again we scored a 123 4/5 fifths rule down and show phrase it takes 245 parameters can you show file name Kia coordinate and K. The names of parameters are arbitrary but I I like to name them to be similar to the grammar rules and I he was a little key to mean a constant string K for constant so the first parameter mask will contain the parsing post out data structure for a "capital show" the second parameter lowercase file name will contain the result of calling file name rule in the fabricator and if you follow that will we drop down to a couple more rules down file name it takes a name as a perimeter and returns of buildup string that contains only the value of the name of that point and figure out what the name is it that point you need to look at the grammar the grammar will call the name rule the name rule takes a letter and a bunch of letters zero or more letters name rest* any fabricator stream with the first letter followed by the rest of the letters and returns that back up and if you keep going down both of the fabricator rules you'll see the name first takes a letter and it returns the letter in a string and the name rest the name rest is a rule that takes one character and returns the character in the name rule the name rest is called zero call it is involves zero or more times that parameter is actually in iterator parameter containing a bunch of name rests or zero numerous depending on what was really there in the original in the info if we go back to show phrase third parameters K art which just matches the double quotes a T double quotes and then the next parameters capital coordinate which is another rule call with returns a number, another number in this case that's all we needed we can do more interesting things then spitting back the numbers with a comma in between them but we didn't need to do that in this case and the final parameter is just a constant Character Dodd and when will that show phrase rule the fabricated rule is called with those five parameters it construct a string that looks like [Double quotes image double cords, double quotes the value of the string return by the file name rule double quotes, the string returned by the coordinate rule of ] And end of spring end of fabricators Street and then if you look at the output of the final output you'll see that it looks like that's what we've done as we've take them a bunch of matches and rearrange them and put characters around them and the resulting string looks like Jason
