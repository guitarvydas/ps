Pertinent to last night's discussion...

How does one navigate a tree of information in a browser? 

Am I missing something?

Imagine that we are browsing a page that has 2 links in it, let's call them "left" and "right".

We dive down into the "left" link, then return using BACKSPACE.  

How do we remember that we still need to visit the "right" branch?

What if every node in the "left" branch has 2 more nodes in it?  How far down can we go before we forget which branches we have yet to visit?

The problem is exacerbated by wiki/Obsidian links that create graphs, not trees, or information.  How do you backtrack and ensure that you have visited every node (at least once, maybe exactly once)?

Maybe the problem is solved and I just don't know the answer/operation...

Changing the colour of already-visited links works only up to a point.   I'm not sure that Obsidian does even this much...  You still need to keep a stack of bookmarks in your head.
