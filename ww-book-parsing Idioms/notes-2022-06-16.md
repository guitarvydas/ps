Breakfast OK, Lunch maybe, dinner no (under control)
FYI: We have been having muffins for breakfast and peanut-butter/cold-cuts for lunch, but are open to suggestions.
In general: I would like to see the boys, I would like to babysit for a few hours again, I would like to see your new house.  I don't know if Mom is ready for a long car ride yet.
