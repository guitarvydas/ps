Descript fix black waveform:

I'm having exactly the opposite problem.  The transcription figures out the underlying word, but the audio cuts out part of the word (I see a black waveform).  For example, I spoke the word "phrase".  The transcription contains the word "phrase", but the playback sounds like "fray" ("phra").

I'm a newbie and just trying out Descript on existing content (more questions here: https://discord.com/channels/764925197379174411/764925197379174414/996261302899056730)

1. Ohm-JS
2. Mithril.

(Mithril === OCG, mithril creates operands, not syntax)
