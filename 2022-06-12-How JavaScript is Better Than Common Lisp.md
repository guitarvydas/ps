Javascript uses prototype inheritance instead of class-based inheritance.

Class-based inheritance is a subset of prototype inheritance.  Class-based inheritance is a way to organize inheritance so that it can be optimized by a compiler.

Prototype inheritance is a "bicycle for the mind", while class-based inheritance is a "tugboat".

One of the goals of Lisp systems was to allow *ad-hoc* implementation of ideas.  Classes are used to remove *ad-hoc*ness from designs so that the code may be compiled.
