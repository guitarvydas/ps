issues:
1 - I click on a word and set the cursor, hit space bar, playback begins at some other previous point (but, only sometimes :-) (I haven't figured out the cause, but it seems to get stuck in the same paragraph, when it gets stuck) (is there a way to produce a current-state-of-the-world snapshot to send to you?  This current bug is intermittent.  When I move on and work on another paragraph, the problem "goes away")
2 - The Correction workflow is klunky UX-wise.  I'm used to double-clicking on a word (to select it), then typing a correction over it (like I used to do in Word, etc.), instead I have to double-click on the word, then remove my hand from the keyboard and mouse over to the "correct" button, then move my hand back to the keyboard, type the correction, then take my hand off of the keyboard to use the mouse to click on the black "correct" button to accept the change.  If I fail to follow this exact sequence, the correction doesn't stick and I have to start again.  Furthermore, I have - many times - double-clicked on a word and started typing a correction, only to find that nothing is happening (I failed to click on the "correct" button).
3 - The video b-roll zoom-in workflow is klunky, UX-wise.  I dropped a screenshot .png onto a scene and wanted to "zoom in" on a portion of it.  Instead, I had to fool directly with X/Y values.  It took me about 10 minutes to get the zoom I wanted.  I guess that I was expecting to use the scroll wheel or cmd+ or something like that. (Set the cursor, zoom in, keeping the cursor centered).
4 - Studio Sound sounds great, except on my voice.  I insert a lot of 'um's (which can easily be lanced out), but, I drag out words as I try to think as I talk.  Studio Sound makes me sound like a robot (I guess that it is gating my words and chopping the ends (and fronts?) off of too many of them).  My favourite trick in Logic was to use a touch of compression, a notch filter and a touch of reverb (notch out the nasally range, iirc, somewhere in the 1k-3k range, very narrow notch).  I haven't yet tried this kind of thing with Descript, but I probably will when I get tired of sounding like a robot.
0 - environment: 2018 MacBook running Monterey.  Building very simplistic screencasts of full-screen Scapple mind-maps and the occassional still screenshot.  Using control-shift-5 to record the screencast using Quicktime, then dropping the .mov into a Descript storyboard project.  Using an Apple Magic Mouse (scroll wheel faked out using a vertical swiping action). Current project: https://beta-share.descript.com/view/gdfwt4MfKjF
