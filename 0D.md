# 0D
Zero-dependencies.

- no dependencies whatsoever
- insidious dependencies include:
	- name-calling, hard-wired names of target functions (e.g. libraries)
	- over-use of synchronization
		- call-return uses the call-stack as a global variable
		- call-return mutates the call-stack
		- call-return blocks the caller while it waits for the callee to *return* (a hidden dependency)
	- hard-wired routing
