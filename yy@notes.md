riffing on thoughts in this thread: Until fairly recently we didn't have electricity and had to make tools out of mechanical things.  We got pervasive electricity only in the last 100+ years.  The first electric motors were used for pumping water uphill to make streams that could run textile mills.  Our only tools for analysis were clay tablets, pencils and paper, hence, we developed techniques to pound everything down to 2D (x,y) which did a disservice to our understanding of our 4D world (x,y,z,t).  We model 4D electrical effects using 2D devices (oscilloscopes, which are kinda 2.5D (x,y,t)).  We can't build pyramids like the Mayans did, but we are sure that we can measure everything and we are sure that reality is composed only of that which we can quantify in 2D.  In pre-Copernican cosmology we resorted to "epicycles" to force-fit observations into our techniques for analysis (one of my favourite books is "The Sleepwalkers" by Koestler).  I think that we can escape 2D analysis by using layers (Peter Lee made Denotational Semantics usable this way).

Comments don't work.  

I believe in FDD (Failure Driven Development).

Yes, I am concerned with communicating programs to other people, but, the above points niggle at me.  

API: syntax is the ultimate form of API.  We haven't been allowed to use syntax for API since it was very difficult to build syntaxes and this could be done only slowly.

Very interesting read, IMO: [First Principles Thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles)

thanks - puts a new light on the thread, I went back and re-read,

brainstorming:

#1: Microware OS9 used to wake up and scan all memory for "magic" numbers that were headers for software modules (pluggable as ROMs, at the time)
#2: self-modifying code
#3: NFC, smart cards.  IoT in every datum.  Powered by R.F. if held next to an R.F. emitter.  The NFC standard has been around for at least a decade.
#4: "Code" who/what runs the "code"?  Can the "code" be contained in the data structure?  Tunney APE, shebang, Tunney BLC (and Sector Lisp) etc.
