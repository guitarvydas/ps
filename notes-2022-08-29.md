I think that there are 3 kinds of assembler:
1. line-oriented assembler (what we call "assembler")
2. tree-oriented assembler (Lisp and derivatives)
3. 0D-oriented assembler (I can't think of any existing one at the moment, but I'm working on it)

(0D means "zero dependency" - e.g. like *processes* in an operating system).

Visualization: what is being visualized?  The operation of a computing machine?  But, if you are writing code in OO fashion, then the last thing you want to do is to follow low-level control flow of method invocation. (I know this from direct bitter experience).

IMO: Ideal toolset = toolboxes for the above assembler types + ability to drape multiple syntaxes over groupings of assembly primitives.  IMO, that means Lisp + Ohm-JS.  Debuggers, ideally, should be aware of the various syntaxes and allow programmers to continue thinking in those terms (instead of forcing them to think about low-level, assembler, operations).

Assembler - common themes:
- no syntax
- very, very regular ("repetitive", "normalized")

A note to say "thank you" to everyone.  It's been wonderful working with you all.  I will see you at Christmas or earlier.

Why are you asking about Lisp, specifically?  Instead of something more modern like JavaScript or Python, etc?

Lisp is a tree-oriented assembler.  That's why I love it.  Currently, my 2 favourite tools are Lispworks Ohm-JS (with Ohm-Editor).  

For "creativity" you want a debugger with a good UX. But, for Production Engineering, you want type-checking and all of the associated baubles and gotchas. 

(For other types of Engineering, e.g. Test Engineering, Maintenance Engineering, etc., you give priority to different sets of baubles).

Lispworks is the best debugger I've encountered.  

When exploring, the UX really, really, really matters.  A bag containing every feature under the sun is not good enough for exploration.  Simplicity ("the lack of nuance") matters when exploring.  Complexity - lots of choices - matters when doing Production Engineering.

I +wish+ that I had a lispified and 0D-ed JS.  JS simply needs to go back to Kindergarten and learn how to count function arguments.  0D, to me, means not-using-functions as a way to communicate between asynchronous program units. (0D == zero dependency).

Lisp is a tree-oriented assembler.  That's why I love it.  

Currently, my 2 favourite tools are Lispworks (for power and debugging) and Ohm-JS with Ohm-Editor (for draping multiple paradigms/syntaxes over powerful baubles).

IMO, creativity and engineering are very deep, different topics with many subdivisions, each.

> do we _really_ need a visualizer?

IMO, debugging belongs to the realm of creativity, not of clockwork engineering.

Debugging is iteration.  Debugging is notation-specific.  Debugging is paradigm-specific.  For example, if you Design a system using, say, the OO paradigm, you want a debugger that shows you the OO-iness of your code, not, say, machine-level single-stepping in a completely different paradigm.

Your Handmade-network video reminds me of a long-standing je ne sais quoi I've had about [GVL](https://equis.cs.queensu.ca/~equis/pubs/1992/cordy-jvlc-92.pdf) . Kind of a REPL with projectional editing mixed in.

So, your question about "visualization" might be rhetorical - visualization of 'what'?

IMO, the question about “visualization” might be rhetorical - visualization of *what*?

Debugging belongs to the realm of creativity, not of clockwork engineering.

Debugging is iteration.  Debugging is notation-specific.  Debugging is paradigm-specific.  For example, if you Design a system using, say, the OO paradigm, you want a debugger that shows you the OO-iness of your code, not, say, machine-level single-stepping from a completely different paradigm.

@Kartik Agaram’s Handmade-network video reminds me of a long-standing *je ne sais quoi* I’ve had about [GVL](https://equis.cs.queensu.ca/~equis/pubs/1992/cordy-jvlc-92.pdf) . Kind of a projectional editing REPL (based on simplistic-SVG?).

observation: I used the builtin recorder 3 times, then tried to edit.  It seems that the recordings are overlaid, showing 3 "musical note" icons and very thin green and purple strips.  I can't insert "/" between the note icons in the transcript.  I don't know how to move the recordings to be sequential in time, not overlaid.  Actually, I recorded once, then edited, shortening the clip, then, I recorded 2 more times without editing in between - it seems that everything is boxed in to the length of the 1st recording.
