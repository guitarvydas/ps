Here’s a question (not a challenge):

Why should you care?

“Efficiency” has been grossly over-emphasized.  If we use divide-and-conquer, we see two (2) versions of efficiency:
1. efficiency for the end-user
2. efficiency for the developer

Mostly all of our programming languages & indoctrination have been in aid of (1). 

I think that the above question arises out of consideration for (1) - efficiency for the end-user, developers be damned.

## Lisp 1.5

McCarthy had a simple view.  Every symbol contained a stack of values, and the symbol's "current value" was the top of its stack.  McCarthy implemented this as *alists*.

McCarthy's Lisp 1.5 was *pure* functional programming.

Since then, the programming community has jammed all sort of parameters into McCarthy's simple vision with the result being: bloatware.

Mutability was inserted into the simple concept.  This caused epicycles around memory management, since memory was not *always* arranged in a stack-like manner. GC (garbage collection) needed to be invented to manage this subtle change.

Then, the simple vision was pushed well out of its sweet spot through the insertion of *cncurrency*.  Concurrency doesn't work cleanly with little stacks, so lots of epicycles had to be invented, e.g. "thread safety", "semaphores", "priority sharing", etc., etc.  These problems were worsened by the fact that the *call stack* is implemented - in hardware - as a shared, global variable.  There used to be a time when CPUs did not have call-stacks hard-wired into them (e.g. IBM 360) and compilers had to implement *call-stacks* using multiple instructions.

Maybe, Lisp 1.5 was the last instance of *pure* functional programming?  Now, maybe, the circle has been closed with Sector Lisp.

## Sector Lisp

Sector Lisp is a re-implementation of McCarthy's Lisp.

Sector Lisp has a newer, purely functional, garbage collector which is only 40 bytes[sic] in length.

Sector Lisp's GC is so small, because it can rely on *pure* functional progamming and true immutability.  Lists are little stacks, you can tack things onto the front of lists (CONS) and you can pull things off of the top of the little stacks (CAR) and you can use pop things off of lists (CDR).  Structure sharing is free.  Scoping is free.  You can tack an item onto a list and pass the extended list to a function.  When the called function returns, the original list, without the tacked-on item, is restored, due to structure sharing.  Cheap.  Magical.

You can't do that with heaps and OO.  But, you can do concurrency with OO objects, and you can't do concurrency with *pure* functions (you have to impurify the functions and invent an epicycle called an *operating system* and it needs to invent the epicycle called *preemption* to thwart the blocking behaviour of functions.)

# Back to the Question

So, what happens when we have
```
dtype ⟨Other x y⟩
dtype ⟨Dest target ⟨Other⟩ x y⟩
```
?

I think that something like the following might work:
```
--> ⟨Dest target {"x": ...} {"y": ...}⟩
```
Where ... is a little stack (a left-to-right List).

Each variable, like `x` and `y`, are maps that contain an ordered set of values.  In raw Lisp, we might say that `x_theList` is a list.  The *current value* of the *variable* named `x`, is the first item on that list, i.e. (CAR x_theList) 

Considering efficiency:
1. Does the answer run "fast enough" on end-user hardware. No. Can it be made faster? Yes.
2. Does the answer run "fast enough" on developer machines? Yes. Can it be made faster?  Who cares?  It can be made to run faster if we make the developers suffer and appease the compilers, by insisting on things like declaration-before-use, strong typing, etc., etc.  But, development machines are fast and it is OK to burn CPU cycles on development machines when this saves Development Time.

Note that original JavaScript began to leak the little-stack (alist) concept back into development.  More recent tweaks to the JavaScript language have made it more 1-ish at the expense of developer effort.

## Side Benefit of Small Is Beautiful Languages

Note that there is a side benefit to the *small is beautiful* version of development languages: it becomes a *lot* easier to automatically generate (transpile, compile) code into *small is beautiful* development languages.  I argue that a code generation paradigm will speed up development time.  As an example of the opposite approach, consider the Python indentation syntax and programming languages that require declaration-before-use.  Most of the current crop of code-generation tools are based on structured syntaxes (not indentation syntaxes) and on byte-oriented characters and a single stream of output.  It is painful to generate code for declaration-before-use languages (not impossible, just more painful than necessary (think of this subtle difference as a UX issue)).  Assembler has a regular syntax and no restrictions like declaration-before-use.  Assembler is hard to read for humans, but, is a breeze to read and write, for machines.  Likewise, Lisp has a regular syntax and no declaration-before-use restrictions.  It would be "easy" to write programs that write Lisp programs.  In fact, it is so "easy" to generate Lisp code, that it has already been done.  Lispers call such magical code-generating programs "macros".

1.  ) you can already do this by paint selecting cards and selecting ‘copy ‘ or ‘move’

Yes.  I argue (elsewhere) that "completeness" and "UX-ness" are not the same thing.  Reducing friction is a UX design concept.  Before Kinopio, I loved Scapple because of its low-friction approach.  Scapple, also, does not support "easy" punch-down operation.  I am big on "layering" ATM...

    2) v cool idea , what context would you use straight lines for? Is it purely aesthetic or do you see straight lines as better for certain tasks?

In Engineering school (at least in the '80s) budding Engineers were forced to take a drafting course.  All writing was done in a specific font, all lines were straight (horizontal and vertical).  Unifomity => normalization => readability (teachable readability).  Curvy lines are marketing doo-dads.  Straight lines are Engineering.

    3) that’s been request before so it’s def on the list

All cards same size => normalization.  See above for my bias.

    4) what do you see as being the ‘back’ key in this case? As well as other traversal keys?

Hmm, maybe a visible button.  Browsers already support a Back key, but, this is more specific.  If you start out on a specific space, then hit the magic button/keystroke, the computer figures out which is the parent space and opens it.  If you start out in a parent space, then dive down, you can use the browser Back gesture (no advantage in this scenario).

    5) there are ways to hack this w tag naming , but no immediate plans for tag nesting due rn bc of the niche /power user nature of the feature (edited)

Maybe (5) is related to other issues anyway.  "Nesting" and "layering" are the keywords in my mind.

    
6.  _[_11:22 AM_]_
    
    6) not sure if this is what you mean but you can filter the visibility of only certain connections on spaces by clicking Search , then the filter button

I LOVE the filtering on connections and tags.  Low friction, though, implies that I don't need to know ahead of time what hierarchy I want (tags are kinda that, but are not hierarchical themselves (you can't tag a tag, can you?)).  To clarify: I want to CHOOSE how to view connections and turn them ON and OFF dynamically (like filtering with a vengeance).  As I write this, I begin to wonder whether I can associate a connection with a tag.  That might be enough for me...

    7) can you give me specific examples of the kinds of workflows you want between kinopio and obsidian?

Thimking.  In general, I want to visually arrange Obsidian \[\[...\]\] sections, but, type text into them.  I guess that I want a mix between visual and textual content.  As per the UX comment above, I want it to "be easy" and low-friction.  I like Obsidian because I can iterate.  I start writing.  When I've written to much, I demote the lump of text to a \[\[...\]\] sub-section of its own using control-N and Cut/Paste.  Control-N creates a new document, cut/paste deletes the lump of text from the mainline and puts it into the new document.  Then, I have to manually go back to the main document and type in a reference to the new document (this is a high friction operation and I try to avoid it.  I guess that I'm asking Kinopio to solve this problem which isn't solved in Obsidian (I haven't checked Obsidian's community plugins)).

#2 "Do something, anything" is better IMO.  It might generate whining and new ideas for different solutions.  In songwriting (and the Arts), this is called "brainstorming".  Perfection comes much later.

Would you rather that we don't go today?  We aren't constrained to seeing Nani only on weekends.  By default, we were assuming that we would go to Nani's today and we're both OK with that, but, we don't have to go today.

If you would rather that we don't go today, we're OK with that.   We're both OK with going today, too.
