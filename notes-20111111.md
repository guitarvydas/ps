[brainstorming: maybe these features already exist?]

Feature questions/wish-list/requests:
1) I develop ideas iteratively.  When a space becomes "too busy" I want to select a bunch of cards and move them to a new space, replacing the selection by a single card which refers to the new space (I can do this now, using multiple steps, I want to "bind" a keystroke to a script (a "macro"), I guess, or have it built-in)
2) Straight lines (instead of curvy lines) for connections
3) Ability to make all cards the same size in a space (regardless of their content)
4) Back key to allow up-traversal to "parent" card in "parent" space (related to (1)), 
	- easy (single-stroke) navigation up and down a space hierarchy 
5) easy tag inheritance - cards "below" a header card can be adorned with a tag relating them back to the header
6) observation: connections are simply tags made visible ; wish-list: ability to display connections based on tag (kinda-like different views on multiple inheritance), like Obsidian graph view where the lines depend on a chosen tag ; I think of components like electronics ICs - a bunch of input pins and a bunch of output pins - maybe tag-graphing "solves" the problem of how to allow multiple pins on a component and how to show connections between pins
7) I've been using Obsidian for "blogging" (before that github Pages, before that Scrivener and Scapple), I don't know what I want, but I wonder if it would be possible to easily (one stroke) tie Kinopio and Obsidian together (I don't actually know how to do this even with multiple strokes) ; I feel that Obsidian's text-editor is a better input GUI for text

I'm about to think on nested grammars - unless there is already a solution (do let me know).

For example 
1. match in general a rule like `xyz "string"`
2. punt matched sub-capture, e.g. `"string"`, to another parser to  parse the contents
3. The `"string"` parser might (or might not) punt captures to sub-sub-grammars, recursively

(This can be done trivially in Javascript, using Javascript functions that, each, use Ohm-JS.  And, this can be done trivially using Ohm-JS rules.  Yet, I feel that there is /something/ about not having to specify the whole grammar in one big file.  Maybe all I need is `include`?  M4 already provides `include`s for arbitrary text.  More thinking required.  And, being able to stub-out the top-level match of `"string"` without needing to think about it immediately).

---

I would think that `${ ... }` can be parsed using PEG, as long as `...` doesn't contain unmatched braces.  Unless I'm missing something?

I like PEG, because PEG can parse matched brackets, whereas LR(k) can't.  I've been playing with incremental transpilation using snippets of verbatim (whitespace that doesn't get disappeared and can hold arbitrary code that isn't meant to be further parsed)...
```
const grammar = String.raw`
Verbatim {
  Main = "<unused - override this in descendant grammars (:= instead of =)>"
  verbatimspace = lv verbatim+ rv spaces
  verbatim = 
    | lv verbatim+ rv -- nested
    | anychar         -- leaf
  anychar= ~lv ~rv any

  lv = "\u{00ab}" // "«"
  rv = "\u{00bb}" // "»"
}

Tester <: Verbatim {
  Main := (verbatimspace | ignore)+
  ignore = anychar
}
`;
