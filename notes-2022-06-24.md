Kinopio: 
Is there a way to reduce clutter be demoting?
- e.g. 
	- TODO has 20 items on it
	- lasso group of 3
		- push group to another space
		- replace group by 1 card
	- now, only 18 items on TODO
	- continue demoting until 7+-2 items on TODO 
	- what happens if I change an item in a demoted group?
		- expected: summary group card on TODO changes in some way
		- suggestion: group space has "summarizing" function which produces text of summary card in parent (easiest: "summarizing" function is a lump of JavaScript) (analogy: spreadsheet cells, change a number in one cell, value displayed in another cell updates)
			- is this just a more-general filter function?  Can filter functions be written in a PL (e.g. JavaScript)?

I want to form a group to study why Sector Lisp is soooo much smaller than most other Programming Languages.  SL is <512 bytes [sic - not K, not M, not G, but, bytes] including a 40-byte garbage collector.

Deliverables:
1. Cheat sheet: list of techniques for making software massively smaller
2. Sector Lisp implemented in JavaScript (open to suggestions, e.g. maybe WASM ; to run in any browser) [hope: implementing SL in JS might lead to AHA! moments]
3. Sector Lisp implemented in Ohm-JS with the goal that pseudoe-SL could be transpiled to C++ and just about any other programming language (e.g. Python, Rust, WASM, etc., etc.)

My background: Lisper for many years, organizer of TorLisp monthly Lisp meetup, built a C compiler, bitten by bug for creating better programming IDEs (PL = IDE), FBP, concurrency, 0D, etc.  My first Lisp system was 5K on a Z80, I am amazed at how small Sector Lisp is and I think (hope) that it contains secrets for organizing programs.  I doubt very much that SL's smallness comes *only* from jiggering at the assembly-level.  I believe that first-principles-thinking can lead to AHAs.

- [x] In my vocublary, "dataflow" means a stunted version of concurrency.  Imagine `c = a + b`.  In dataflow, both, a and b must arrive before calculation of `c` is triggered.  In a more-atomic system, either can arrive at any time and the Component figures out when it is OK to calculate `a + b`.  In dataflow, the system triggers the `c = a + b` calculation, whereas in a more-atomic version, your code triggers it (i.e. more flexibility, more possibilities).  Aside, `c = a + b` is a newbie mistake.  FBP and technical diagrams are more useful for expressing concepts that cannot be expressed conveniently in text, rather than re-imagining already-familiar concepts such as mathematical expressions, e.g. text is painful for expressing networks, servers, etc. Aside: I currently believe that there is something even more atomic underneath concurrency, but, that is another discussion...

My notes "as is".  With apologies, I wanted to edit the notes down, but continue to dive into rabbit holes every time I re-visit.  Instead of waiting any longer, here are my raw notes...
