I started to do this, but realized that there is something even simpler! (Oh my).

1. Data is OOP Objects
2. Control flow is Syntax.

My word "handle" is subsumed by instances of OOP objects.

ATM, I am thinking of a language that can only do 1 thing with OOP objects - call methods on them, and, wrapping "control flow" syntax around such objects.

half-baked, still sleeping on it...

I am imagining a way to specify something like:

"I want a Cheeseburger with [Condiment]+".

"I want a Cheeseburger with ..." can be handled with Ohm-JS (or macros, or, ...).

[Condiment] is simply an instance of a Class.  A "handle" to an Object.  You can call methods on the Object.  Something like Interfaces or Duck-Typing can check for valid calls.

"+" is a looping operator like "for".

Then, we might add the concept of "synonyms" to allow us to not have to specify long method calls over and over again (and, to improve readability).

Maybe something like:

synonym colour == [Condiment].colour ()

Can I rewrite a substantial program this way?  Good question, good test.  IDK yet.

How many parameters can a method call have?  I'm thinking 0 or 1.  No more than 1.  Can the parameter be another Object?  Yes, I think so.

Hey, "1 parameter" == Currying.

Hey, "synonym" == (lambda (...) ...), e.g. "syn colour = lambda (obj): return obj.colour ()"

Can you do this in Python today?  Yes.

To ponder: the syntax "a+b" is just syntactic sugar for "a.plus(b)".  Ohm-JS can be used to transpile "a+b" into "a.plus(b)".

... still pondering ...
