I want to cut/paste audio into a slideshow.

I'm using Storyboard on a Mac.

I have audio that I'm happy with (in a Descript project).

I have recorded video of a set of keynote slides, simply counting 1..14.

I dropped the video onto a new scene.  Intending to carve it up into 14 scenes, then, cut/paste the above audio into the scenes.

I drop the video of the slides into a scene and I get an audio transcription, but the video is missing.

I'm probably doing something wrong.  I would be happy to change my workflow.  I'm new to thinking this way and would like some suggestions.

easy question, I hope:

background: regarding project:

https://web.descript.com/5386aded-ff3b-46df-9cf4-0e00ae769375/e3ece

I recorded audio, then, later video (slides done with Apple Keynote).

question: I want the audio from scene 4 to use the video of the scene where I say "5" (at the very bottom of the composition).  I want to remove the audio saying "5" and replace it with the audio for "You cannot block waiting for functions to return values.".
