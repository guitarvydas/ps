Many of my blog posts were on Github Pages.

I have recently switched to using Obsidian Publish for blogging.

I am still learning how best to use Obsidian Publish.

Comments about the content are welcome.

Meta-comments about the blogging technique are, also, welcome.

I hope to set up a Discord server for comments.
