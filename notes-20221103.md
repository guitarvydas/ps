It is unlikely that I can attend tonight, but, I did read the paper.  Here are some of my knee-jerk thoughts:

> ... Consider another core part of the C abstract machine's memory model: flat memory. ...

Not quite accurate.

At the time that C was invented, memory was already layered.  The layers were called "registers", "RAM", "ROM", "files", "drum", etc., etc.  

Memory layers and caches are the same thing. Caches are nothing new.  We've simply added more layers of caching (Lxxx, browser caching, etc.)

A different view of C is that it *elides* certain kinds of memory and directly addresses only some kinds of memory.  Physicists learn this trick early in school and call it "making an approximation".

> Your computer is not a fast PDP-11.

I agree and pine for this kind of reality.  In fact, I wish I had chips with 1,000, 8-bit MC6809s on them.  (So, why don't I use a Chuck Moore GreenArray?).  

I think that the main reason for the absence of kilo-core technology is because the issue of simultaneity (often called "parallellism") is not addressed with a suitable notation.  I view "thread libraries" as low-level opcodes for creating ad-hoc, multi-threaded operations, crying out for a better notation.

From my perspective, the real cause of the problems is the attitude of "one size fits all".  E.g. trying to use C as a programming language for every kind of program.  IMO, fear of parsing, and, fear of inventing new notations (languages) leads to one-size-fits-all-ness.  (IMO, "Kill Math" is an expression of anti-one-size-fit-all-ness, as are Feynman diagrams).  

IMO focus on the end result (code) might be replaced by focus on the process of creating notations, e.g. notation reuse, ease-of-parsing, better editing, etc.

Overuse of the C notation appears to be the point of the last section of the article.

cottage closing: We're thinking of going up and closing the cottage this weekend, unless, you guys still want to use the cottage.

rodent spray: I had the eaves cleaned and the roof repaired.  The roof was damaged by racoons.  They sprayed parts of the roof with a peppermint spray and left some for me to spray "around the house".  I will spray the base of the east and west sides of the house unless you have reservations.  There seems to be no warning regarding pets, just against the strong odour of peppermint.  OK?

BTW: Thanks for the feedback. “Queues vs. Stacks” shows how appallingly simple this is to implement.  Fire-and-forget says something else - it’s about an effect that the reader doesn’t necessarily know is desirable. Ex. The human body has relatively slow pathways for communication (msec instead of nsec), yet, accomplishes more than what we can do with much-faster computers.  I attribute this to massive simultaneity and lack of micro-management (non-clockwork-iness).  Distributed processing, e.g. IoT, robotics, internet, etc., needs to go in this direction, IMO, to achieve autonomous operation.  University researchers Wulf and Lewthwaite have shown that “external focus” is better for sports than “internal focus” (goals instead of micro-management).  The best book on Golf ("The Inner Game of Tennis" [sic]) talks about Self1 and Self2.  And, how one's game goes down the tubes if Self1 interferes with Self2.  Self1 is what I call "consciousness" (single thread) whereas Self2 is what I call the "autonomous" system that signals my heart to tick and my lungs to breathe in the background.
