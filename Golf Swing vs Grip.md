Striking a golf ball does not require power, it requires speed.

The best was to get speed is to *swing* the clubhead, not to power it.

When you swing the clubhead, swing it like 

-  [ ] your arms extend to their fullest extension
- due to centrifugal force, that you generate by swinging the clubhead
- centrifugal force is what Olympic Hammer throwers use, the "ball" is on a loose chain that is extended to its maximum by centrifugal force

I pronouce "centrifugal" as "cen tri fi kal"

- [ ] left hand V's right
- [ ] right hand V's left
