I'm a guitarist schooled in 
- Johnny WInter
- Jimi  Hendrix
- The Beatles
- Jethto Tull (Ian Anderson)

I'm watching Ana Vidovic on youtube and loving it.

But,  I see
- she is using only 8 of her 10 fingers
	- her left thumb is on the back of the neck
	- her right-hand pinky seems to be out of the picture

When I type on my keyboard,  I use 10 fingers.

When I use a mouse, I use all 5 fingers of my left hand and all of my right hand to operate one mouse.

Jimi Hendrix used his neck-hand thumb to fret notes.
	- thanks to the skinny neck of his Strat, he could wrap his thumb over the neck and reach the strings 
	- Hendrix was left-handed, so he used his right hand on the neck
	- Hendrix used a whammy bar.

A guitar is different from a violin 
	- a guitar is fretted 
	- a violin is non-fretted.

Fretted = digital, non-fretted = analogue?

Nuance in violin-playing seems to come from wiggling the left hand fingers (on the neck) *back and forth*, which results in slight pitch changes in the note (sharp and flat).

Nuance in guitar-playing seems to come from wiggling the left hand fingers *up and down* (resulting in sharp notes, never flat notes).

## Whammy Bar

A whammy-bar on a guitar can sharpen and flatten notes.

## Strumming

Strumming notes on a guitar does not play notes "all at once" (like playing a chord on a piano).

Strumming a guitar plays notes in sequence with subtle delays between the notes.

## Picking Notes Instead of Strumming Notes

Notes that are picked, gently, by the right hand (the non-neck hand) are usually picked upwards instead of being picked downwards.

## Rock Guitar

I like rock guitar more than I like classical guitar.

Why?

In rock, the notes are often in the Blues Scale.

In rock, the notes are usually down-picked, hard.  

In rock, often, multiple notes are down-picked.

Hard down-picking makes the note go slightly sharp at first[^hard], then return to its natural pitch.

[^hard]: I haven't measured this.  Is this correct?  

Classical guitar sounds "sterile" to me.  Hard rock sounds "aggressive" to me.  Hard rock sounds "more nuanced" to me.  The guitar-player matters.  Some players hit the strings harder than other players - each has their own style.  Classical guitar seems to emphasize note-choice nuance instead of note-bending nuance.

## Wah-Wah Pedal

A wah-wah pedal does not change the pitch of notes.

A wah-wah pedal is a movable band filter.  It changes (filters) the harmonic content of notes and chords, esp. when the guitar is distorted.

## Distortion

Square-wave distortortion changes the harmonic content of a sound.

Square waves have lots of high-frequency harmonics, which make the wave be more-square than it would have been.  Actually, the harmonics were always there, but distortion changes their relative amplitudes.

Tube distortion sounds "different" from transistor distortion because tubes tend to emphasize even harmonics and transistors tend to emphasize odd harmonics.  (I'm not sure why that is, but I think that I have measured it).

## Phase

Waves are related to one another via phase.  The peak of one wave is relatively offset from the peak of another wave by its phase (phase angle).

Human bodies have ears that are located in different places on the head.  Humans perceive sounds as "coming from" different directions by detecting the relative phases of the sounds.  The peak of one wave hits one ear before it hits the other ear.  Human brains can perceive this slight timing difference and assign a "location" to the incoming sound.  (Aside: audiophile equipment pays careful attention to reducing phase distortion (MP3s and CDs might have better performance in the frequency spectrum than previous kinds of audio equipment, but, the rest of the story is that they distort phase (and maybe some other aspects))).


## Computer Keyboard vs. Piano Keyboard

Piano keyboards allow loud-and-soft striking.

Computer keys are on-and-off.

Piano keyboards allow chords - multiple notes - to played

Piano keyboards allow notes to be held for different durations of time.

Computer keyboards require less arm movement.  To hit a low note on a piano, one has to move one's arm from the central position.  To hit any key on a computer keyboard, does not require repositioning of the arm (this it not true when a mouse is used).


## Computer Keyboard

A computer keyboard consists of keys that are binary in function - on or off.

What if the keys were wiggly?  Instead of on and off, they could be 90% on and 90% off?  

The technology for this already exists, but it tends to be arranged in piano-keyboard layouts instead of QWERTY layouts.

Or, what if the keys were encoded in floating point?  Never giving exactly an integer value.

In fact, keys might be encoded in 3D - velocity[^pressure] and NSEW[^nsew].

[^pressure]: Pressure.  Attack.

[^nsew]: North South East West

Maybe the software driver for keyboads has a dial, allowing users to choose from binary to full 3D in a continuum.

Maybe every QWERTY key is velocity-sensitive and bendable?

## 10 Fingers

Anything that doesn't use all 10 human fingers is insufficient for use as an expressive device...
