Not all rhymes should be perfect rhymes.

Perfect rhymes give a *feeling* of completeness, happiness.

Imperfect rhymes fool the ear and give a *feeling* of longing, tension.

I use [B-Rhymes](http://www.b-rhymes.com) as my first line of inquiry, before I look at [rhymezone](https://rhymezone.com)

A list of b-rhymes is, also, useful as a brainstorming tool.
