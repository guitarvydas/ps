Music, as does all art, depends on creating tension, then releasing the tension.

How do you create tension when music is removed?

Words.

Choosing words and word rhythms carefully.

Use of line lengths.

Use of rhyme and informed use of anti-rhyme.

Use of syllable accents.

Number of syllables in a line.

Number of lines in a verse/chorus.  (For example, an even number of lines, e.g. 4, gives a feeling of completeness, while an odd number of lines, e.g. 3, gives a feeling of longing and incompleteness).

The master of word-crafting analysis, is IMO, [[Pat Pattison]].

Pat documents the use of [*voice leading*](https://www.patpattison.com/reviews) in lyrics.
