“DSL” usually means text-based.  

Component-based programming [^cbp]does not lend itself well to text.

[^cbp]: FBP is a subset of CBP (Component-Based Programming).  Computer networks are a different subset.

FBP as text is a “horrible UX” in my opinion. Do-able, but horrible.

We use text languages because of inherent fear of compiling diagrams and overlapping windows.

Our fear was generated in the mid-1950s and no longer represents reality.

I *think* that it is better to show how easy it is to transpile diagrams and hide the resulting text (if any).

PEG allows new dimensions in language design.  

You can nest languages inside of languages.  This opens up new - simpler - possibilities.

Current-day languages suffer from lack of divide-and-conquer.  You get 2 choices - (1) build *everything* in one language, or (2) build it in assembler.

If it were easy to create language stacks, you could chip away at the problems in smaller, simpler, bits.

I claim that it is easy to create language stacks.  

The onus remains on me to prove this assertion.
