True Divide and Conquer means creating things in layers.

Interested in technical diagrams.

> I'm very interested in this topic of writing/kinopio/obsidian. I usually start working on a paper in Kinopio. It is great to lay out ideas and quickly move them around. However, it soon (too soon!) because too tedious to manage my scraps. I want to start ordering and outlining my thoughts, but it's a lot of manual effort. (For example, if I had a column of cards, and I want to insert a few ideas. That requires selecting, moving down, creating a card, then selecting to tidy up. And if I want to move the stack, each time I have to reselect. Yes boxes can help, but they are currently very fiddly. They don't resize, and once you start running into other cards, it gets hard to manage). That's why I've been a big advocate of ways to group/clump/make a list of cards. I can start composing higher orders of thought. A paragraph. A list of items.

Thinking out loud...
1. Currently I think that the Answer To Everything ® is *layers*.  Being able to "easily" push down and go back up should make the workflow work. [Software-wise, the first part of the answer is to stop using functions and to achieve 0D (zero depdendency).  Functions implicitly use LIFOs (stacks) whereas 0D and layering needs FIFOs (queues)].  Obsidian does layers with `[[...]]` and Control-N and command-option-left/right (FYI: `[[...]]` allows you to refer to a named .md file - you can either dive into it or, if it doesn't exist yet, create it and dive into it) ; Control-N creates a new .md file ; command-option-left/right gives you Backward and Forward based on the history of which files you were editing (I wonder if this based on a "list" of open files?  Backward and Forward simply move circularly in the list and the editor)). More thought / discussion needed.
2. "... once you start running into other cards, it gets hard to manage ..." - Drakon has a solution for this called "smart editing".  The Drakon editor simply moves shapes over so that they never overlap (is this just a Constraint-based thing?  The left-edge of a rectangle must be NN pixels away from the right edge of any other rectangle. ?) https://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net (Drakon IS rocket science :-).  More thought / discussion needed.  I would use PROLOG, or something like it (miniKanren, datalog, etc?) to express constraints.  [PROLOG in JS is not hard - my first self-flagellation exercise with Ohm-JS was to write a SCM to JS converter and throw Nils Holm's PROLOG-in-6-Slides at it].
3. I find the Obsidian workflow to be comfortable, except that I lose track when the number of text snippets gets high (no 2D map of what's where ; auto-generating such a map a la graph view is too random, I need to control the layout - the layout contains information, auto-generated layout scrambles that information). More thought / discussion needed.

[continued brainstorming]...
4. Conclusion: (1) Kinopio needs a way to walk around cards, based on keyboard gestures (2) Kinopio needs a "dive down" gesture and a "go back up to parent" gesture.  (NB. "dive down" functionality already exists as a clickable right-arrow button on a card ; "go back up ..." does not exist yet, Kinopio needs a "parent space" field on every card) (the Browser Back button is based on dynamic traversal history, not on a static parent-child relationship) (3) Kinopio's layout policy (user determines layout, no auto-layout) is good
1. for programmers, a keyboard is preferred over a mouse (mouse = 1 hand + 5 fingers, keyboard = 10 fingers)
2. An Obsidian Vault is a directory containing a bunch of .md files and sub-directories
3. Kinopio + Obsidian => a way to use the keyboard to navigate directories (down, up, across) + a way to open a .md editor on a selected .md file ; Kinopio ==> visual layout of "current layer" of a directory, Obsidian ==> add/visit/edit files in the directory `[[...]]`++

The "ideal" number of cards on a hierarhical layer is 7+-2.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two.

The idea of a "file system" is so 1950's.  In 2022, we have networks of distributed computers (let's say Raspberry PIs, for discussion purposes).  Each rPi is a server.  Hmm, so we could imagine that each rPi contains a flat bunch of .md files and some way to reference .md files elsewhere (URLs?).  A "space" is one rPi. Rhetorical question: is a "parent" URL something special, or just another link?  I guess that using a hierarchy is up to the Kinopio user.  We could even try this idea out by putting a bunch of "link cards" on a space.  There are 2 kinds of cards: (1) Content and (2) Link (aka Container and Leaf).  Maybe if we tried this kind of thing we would discover the kind of keystrokes/gestures we would want for rapid navigation.  Maybe there is something more natural ("better") than hierarchy?  Maybe user X would have one network of cards and user Y would have another network of cards.  Both users' networks would end up pointing to the same content, but would get there along different paths. More thought / discussion needed.

IMO, the "problem" with VPLs is that humans expect diagrams to have certain semantics, whereas functions violate those basic assumptions.  Humans draw rectangles and arrows on whiteboards.  They mean for the rectangles to be independent units of action.  Humans figured out ways to deal with independence over the millenia.  1950's Programming Languages violate those techniques - a huge disconnect (yet subtle) and a huge, new learning curve for humanity. Scratch ain't a human-oriented VPL.  Scratch is a synchronous-function-based VPL, that only programmers could love (but don't).  At a very basic level, "functions" mean LIFOs (stacks) whereas "independent components" mean FIFOs (queues).  60+ years of programming language development has given us - bloatware.  Something is very wrong...  Sector Lisp clocks in at less than 512 bytes[sic].  How many bytes is a small Erlang system, a small JS program, a small Python program, a small Rust program, etc., etc.?  Something is very wrong...  

[Functions cannot create totally independent units of code, due to (1) hard-wired names of other functions (2) 
CALL/RETURN (implicit synchrony) (3) implicit routing (4) blocking (functions block waiting for callee to return)]

[I would be glad to discuss further, but am afraid of spamming.  Ask, if interested.]

[I've been chipping away at this issue for years (decades?) and would be happy to bloviate at length about it, but, will stop here to avoid spamming everyone].

Most people expect totally independent units, and, that is what they draw on whiteboards.

-   for entry lambda: what's usually done in `initialize self` that it's different from `initialize current state`
-   for entry lambda: re: `initialize current state`, can some configuration parameters be passed to it? I see a message being passed to the `handler` but I don't see such thing for `initialize current state`. if `initialize current state` takes no parameters, should it be similar to `reset` i.e. instead of `initialize current state`, it's `current state <- default state`
