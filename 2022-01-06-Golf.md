Golf isn't about how hard you can hit the ball, it's about how *gently* you can hit it.

## Convincing Yourself

### Test 1
Take a driver (or rescue club, or whatever) and make a putt on the practice putting green.  Tap the ball. 

The ball flies off the face of the club.

I felt that it was "out of control" and immediately gave up and went back to my shorter putter.  

If I'd stuck with it and practiced it, I would have learned the nuance of how gently to hit the ball.

### Test 2
Take a pitching wedge and pitch a ball onto the practice green by simply dropping the club onto the ball.  

By "dropping" I mean dropping.  If you don't hold onto the club, it simply falls to the ground.  Bang.

If you hold the handle, the club will drop and make a semi-circle at the bottom of the swing.

Hold onto the handle and let the club drop.  

If the clubhead contacts the ball as the clubhead falls, you will see the most beautiful pitch shot you've ever hit.

# Grip
It always puzzled me as to why certain teachers bothered to teach the fundamentals of *grip*.

I get it now.

Forget all of the doo-dads and tips that you learned.

The best way to get a repeatable swing is to do the same thing every time (surprise!).

The easiest way to do the same thing every time is to rely on the physics of swinging.

Swing the clubhead (as if it was on a string instead of on a stiff shaft).

If you swing the clubhead, the clubhead will pull away from you.  That's called *centrifugal force*.

Given your body build and swing speed, the clubhead will always pass the same point in the arc of the swing.

Put the ball at that point.

Clubhead meets ball, repeatably.

As you swing and generate centrifugal force, your arms will get pulled out straight.  

Your arms will always tend to straighten out in at the center of your body.  With the palms centered.

As your arms straighten, they will twist.

If you gripped the handle so that the V's were pointing at your right shoulder, then your arms will twist closed.  The clubhead will follow (it can't help it, you are holding it and your arms are twisting).  The result is that the clubhead will close and you will hit a hook.

You *can* learn to compensate for the inadvertant hook, but why bother?  It takes lots of practice to learn the compensation.  Just put your hands on the club so that, when they straighten, they - and the clubhead - won't twist.

If your V's are pointing left-of-center, then the clubhead will open and you will slice.

If your V's are pointing right-of-center and you still slice, then you are double-compensating.  And, then, you are left to wonder why you have no consistency :-).

If you get the grip right, you don't have to learn to compensate.

If you concentrate on getting the clubhead to move the ball towards your target (like you do, say, in tennis), then that is all that you need to think about.  Your brain/body will do the rest of the minor adjustments based on what you learned when you were just a toddler.  For example, you don't worry about weight shift when you open a door, you just do it.  Your self1 sets the goal, your self2 does the figuring out of *how* to achieve the goal given the current conditions.  Self1 can only bugger up self2 if it tries to micro-manage self2.  The system works like when you ride a bike.  At first, you have to think about it, then you just do it.  If, after learning how to do it, you try to micro-manage the process, you end up in "I don't know how to do this yet" mode - i.e. clumsy and inconsistent.
