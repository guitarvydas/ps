I wish that Kinopio gave me the ability to write snippets of JavaScript to generate/affect cards, like [emacs org-mode](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/)

(I'm developer (retired) and wish that I could use Kinopio as a programming IDE)

Kinopio as a programming IDE

- slap components onto page in any order
- organize after-the-fact
- create groups and "demote" them to new pages, leaving only a single component on the current page
- Leaf components contain code with async inputs and async outputs
- Container components compose components (Leaf or Container) into larger system layers
- use alpha channel to dim certain components
- push a button to generate executable code from a selected system layer

With apologies.  I intended to edit this down, but keep only adding to it. So, to avoid further delay, here are my raw notes:

riffing on previous idea
"my stuff"
a friend just passed away, his wife is going through his contact lists to see who to notify
-> product idea - software safety deposit box
- contains list of contacts
- contains list of passwords
- held at "bank" needing 2 keys (1 bank, 1 owner) 
- contains will
- contains power-of-attorney documents
- instead of a "bank", maybe the safety deposit box should be held at the funeral home, or, with a lawyer (esp. for power of attorney)
- factoid: I know an expert in blockchain who is working on one-off ownership of virtual items (NFTs on steroids?)

-> product idea
- estate = physical + virtual stuff (like NFT Worlds) 
- "worlds" can be granted in wills

aside: Art = experience + "flow" (AKA "in the zone")
my Art is programming, I write code "in the zone", the result is technical
is there an NFT play here?

-> product idea
- NFT World for creation of new software concepts
- includes code
- includes youtubes
- includes Obsidian notes/essays

aside: analogy: NFTs are like virtual "patents".  Disclose technique, but profit from idea (patents: for XX years, NFTs: profit comes as up-front lump sum + royalties)

- I very much liked this article: https://fs.blog/first-principles/, it resonates with the way I look at programming, I note that 5 Whys is suggested by Daniel Pink in Masterclass: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My7hjBp4wH0
- I am writing in Obsidian and using Obsidian Publish to post "blogs"
- I am exploring Kinopio, I think that it might be "the future of programming IDEs", although, currently Kinopio is not about programming ; I think that programming IDEs should be like idea organizers (esp. Scapple and Kinopio)
- I currently think that the root of all evil is "dependencies" and am writing code using 0D (zero dependency) style to prove my point.  If you have 0D, you get diagrams and multitasking for free.  Like Bugs Bunny said, "shoulda turned left at Albuquerque" - wiring synchronization into programming languages is holding us back.  (Synchronization creates implicit dependencies).  I am on record saying that we should deprecate Programming Languages and Operating Systems (they are just epicycles to work around gotchas caused by dependencies).
