Observation: 
- paper notation serves 2 purposes
	1. communicate (e.g. maps, prose)
	2. save thoughts for later introspection and manipulation (e.g. mathematics)
- speech serves only 1 purpose:
	1. communicate
	2. thoughts cannot be easily saved and tend to dissolve over time
Observation:
- AI speech-to-text replaces graphite+rubber for prose
- AI speech-to-text saves thoughts for later introspection
- Computer graphics+animation saves thoughts and enables rapid introspection in greater-than-2D form - "new medium" for expression?

> Note: Speech-to-text being suitable for any purpose whatever, much less replacing handwriting, is extremely variable between people. I'm not at all comfortable drafting out loud; I anticipate keeping my pencils and keyboards my whole life no matter how good STT gets. This matches what I've heard from some of my writer friends when the topic comes up.

aside: speech-to-text is causing me to augment (not replace) my text writing with things I would not have considered doing, e.g. making YouTube videos.  I am saddled with a MacBook, but I don't bother to use Apple Dictation. ATM, I use Descript in place of a video editor. Descript transcribes the audio to text and then lets me edit the video (and audio) using a word processor, i.e. with my fingers and a keyboard instead of with voice, i.e. with word-processing commands instead of timelines and scrubbing.  I use Just Press Record on my iPhone to occasionally record 1-liner reminders/content on a device which has an otherwise hostile HCI (from a developer's perspective).  The recording is transcribed to text and then, magically, shows up on my MacBook, ready for cutting and pasting into a text document, editable using fingers and a keyboard.  I tried OBS and iMovie and da Vinci and did not find them friendly.  I used Logic for editing song demos and am glad to abandon it.

I created book with same Dropbox name as an existing directory, now I have Generation errors and Dropbox conflicts and don't know how to proceed.

I've got duplicates and haven't lost anything.

I wrote a draft of a book in a folder, let's call it "xyz".  Then I created a leanpub book "xyz" thinking that a "manuscript" directory would be added to my "xyz" directory.  Instead, dropbox downloaded the new book to "xyz (1)".

The new book failed generation in step 14.

I tried to fix what I thought was the problem (it wasn't the problem, there must have been a funny character in one of the chapter filenames) and now I'm getting Dropbox conflict errors.

I copied my work to a new temp book and am happily editing that version, but, I don't know how to clean up the mess above.  I +think+ that I want to wipe out the book "xyz" and all other variants, like "xyz (1)", then start afresh, but am open to suggestions and any better way to deal with this.

details: the actual directory is called "programmingisnotcoding" instead of "xyz".  Part of my problem is that I don't know if leanpub is expecting my directory to be named "programmingisnotcoding" or "programmingisnotcoding (1)".  I deleted "programmingisnotcoding (1)" from my local drive, but that made Dropbox unhappy and began giving me conflict errors.  Now I have two local directories "programmingisnotcoding" and "programmingisnotcoding (Pauls-MacBook-Pro-279.local's conflicted copy 2022-12-15)".  At this point I simply stopped guessing and switched to a fresh book.
