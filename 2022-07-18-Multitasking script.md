# Multitasking
multitasking is often called parallelism

The encompassing concept is *concurrency*.

---
# Parallel
All activities are the same and run at the same time.

---

# Simultaneous

activities are different but begin running at the same time

---
# Two Aspects of Concurrency
1. Sequencing and time-variance, and,
2. Absence of inter-dependencies.  0D (zero D).


---
# 0D
- Easily code-up 0D components in existing programming languages
- Discussion elsewhere
