- concurrency is not parallelism
	- often, the two are conflated
- concurrency is a programming paradigm
- parallelism is a specific solution that depends on the problem space and uses the concurrent paradigm
- thread safety
	- kludge to maintain invariants of concurrency
	- tangled up with partial solutions to parallelism
- smallest unit of concurrency
	- O(10 bytes), not megabytes
