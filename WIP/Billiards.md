Billiards is not about *how hard you can hit the ball*, it's about *how gently you can strike the ball and control where it ends up* (backwards, forwards, left, right) to set up the next shot(s).

As you get better, you begin to trust that you can control where the cue ball ends up, and, you can "see" a greater number of plays into the future.
