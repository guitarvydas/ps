Advice trolling: I want to explore the question of "why is programming so hard?". 

I want something like a blog/wiki with votable-y comments.

The blog/wiki is informational and slow-moving, it is a reference (changeable).

Comments can be fast and furious, like discord, with "best" ideas being promoted into the blog/wiki.  (Who gets to decide?  Me, for now,  but I would be very happy to punt).

Default: I am toying with the idea of using Obsidian Publish for the blog/wiki with references to Discord channels.  Default: I will curate (or punt to a volunteer or automation).

Wondering: am I overlooking something, or, is Obsidian+Discord the best option for now?

(ATM, I think that Obsidian is the best way to write markdown, and Discord is the best way to allow active commenting).

(Wondering: if Obsidian, how do I allow collaboration?  Do I have to manually handle promotion?)

(What  I think I really want: Scapple with collaboration and ability to lasso groups and push them into other diagrams.  All diagrams get saved in some sort of markdown-for-svg format, with links and backlinks.  A visual Obsidian.  I would build this in CLOG, but I'm lazy.)
