- preemption is a crutch
- concurrency is a healty lifestyle, parallelism is a greasy hamburger
- 0D ≣ zero-dependency
- What is the smallest unit of concurrency? O(10 bytes)
- programming early games "used to be simpler"
- Epicycle ≣ Accidental Complexity ≣ Working Too Hard ≣ Premature Optimization
- Premature Optimization is a root of Evil
- CPS (Continuation Passing Style) is GOTO on steroids
- multitasking is not hard, unless you try to express it in a synchronous notation
- complexity is in the eye of the beholder
- optimization measure: good optimizations make code smaller (including their own code)
- details kill
- programming languages are IDEs
- tracer bullets for messages
