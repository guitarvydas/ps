Be aware that I have changed things.

I don't know when you are coming back, nor, whether you want/have-time to resume.

The biggest changes:
- I have switched to using Obsidian Publish for blogging instead of github pages.  https://publish.obsidian.md/programmingsimplicity/, but, I am still experimenting on how best to organize this stuff.
- I am striving to produce code that downloads and works.  Previously, I was producing ideas, under the assumption that using using the ideas to create programs would be self-evident to the reader.
- I have stumbled upon an article about "First Principles Thinking" https://fs.blog/first-principles/.

I wonder/believe whether "First Principles Thinking" describes at least part of my approach.  My writing seems to be "all over the place" - a collection of seemingly random observations. I think that I try to find the *atoms* of software, then try to re-synthesize the act of programming.

What I call *simplicity* and what I call *atoms of software* are strongly related. 

I don't think that there is *one* programming language nor *one* thread through all of this stuff.  The idea of atoms allows one to construct any number of molecules that address programming from many angles.  

One angle is never enough. 

"Fads" are created when someone professes one angle to be more important than a plethora of angles.
