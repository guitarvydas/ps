An ė more acurately models a CPU than does a λ.

λs model mathematical functions, but, such functions do not express all of the abilities of CPUs.

For example, to use λ notation, one must:
- ignore at least one dimension, *t* (time)
- guarantee that mutation is not allowed.

It is known that CPUs allow mutation.  Mutable memory is commonly called RAM.

It is, also, known that CPUs can sequence operations in *time* (e.g. video and audio production software).

λ notation might result in a useful sub-model for programming, but, it cannot model the true nature of all of programming for electronic computers.

Analogy: in Physics, it was believed that the *atom* was the smallest indivisible unit of matter, but, today, sub-atomic particles are discussed and explored.
