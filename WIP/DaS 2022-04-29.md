- FYI - there are 2 kinds of parser generators
1. parser generators based on language definitions (YACC, LR(k), etc.)
2. parser generators based on DSLs for specifying parsers (PEG, Ohm-JS, etc.)
- DaS (Diagrams as Syntax) If you are interested in experiments, I would be glad to share
- I argue that graphics is not the problem, but ascribing meaning (semantics) to the diagrams is the problem, start small and build up, e.g.
	- what does a "box" compile to?
	- what do boxes-with-ports-and-arrows compile to?
	-  what do concentric boxes compile to?
- "we already have characters"
	- we use characters for IDEs (aka programming languages) only because mid-1900s hardware made it easier to grok grids of non-overlapping, small bitmaps

- all you really need is SVG + contains () + intersects () + connectedTo ()
- see sections "Expressive Power" and "Ambiguity Detection" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar
	- PEG defines a *parser* in a top-down manner (TDPL), e.g. "if this matches, try to match this next"
	- LR(k) and LL(k) define *languages* in a bottom-up manner, e.g. "if this looks like a number, then bubble it upwards as a number" (regardless of the context) ; this is what is taught as "langage  theory", and is commonly understood to form the basis of parser generators
	- TDPL is order-dependent, Lx(k) is not order-dependent (but more restricted)
