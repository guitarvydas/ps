Hides mutation through the use of binding.

Implemented as Call / Return 
- with implicit synchronization
- with implicit blocking.

Lambda calculus appears to have many types, but, has only one type
- callable function with a synchronous input datum and a synchronous output datum

The data can be destructured into various sub-types.

Handles distributed programming poorly.  FP notation is not designed for distributed programming, due to pervasive synchronization.

Gives rise to notion of callbacks.
