We give the title *smart* to people who can keep a large number of ideas in their heads.  The more the merrier.

Smart people tend not to be able to explain how they do this.

*Less-smart* people have to chunk ideas into a hierarchy, keeping the number of ideas, in each node of the hiearchy, to a minimum.
