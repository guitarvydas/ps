Meta thought: You said that you wanted to use Rebol but were forbidden.  Theory: You didn't really care to use Rebol, you wanted to use the Vid DSL (which happened to be implemented in Rebol).  Q: Why were you not able to use Vid without needing to use Rebol, too?  What if Vid were a little ball of functionality, like a UNIX shell command?  Theory: the hold-back is that that API of Vid is the complete 'syntax' of Rebol.  What if you could design any API syntax easily, and, say, write code in Python and have it use the Vid ball of functionality?  What if you could use Vid in Sector Lisp?  I guess there might be a sub-DSL written as a string in Python and in Sector Lisp that would hook to Vid.  Over time, something better than just a string might be invented.  Suggestion: break-out to the sub-DSL is written inside unicode brackets instead of quotes, e.g. ⟪ ... ⟫.  Suggestion: mini-compiler checks the innards of ⟪ ... ⟫ for legal Vid-iness.  Experiment: write a Python string that creates a Vid UI and inserts Python data into it.  Q: What does that look like?  First blush: raw Rebol with some kind of way to splice Python data/functions into it, e.g. f'...{...}...' strings ... Step 1: write the string.  Step 2: stare at it and riff on it. Step 3: depends on step 2. Step 0: don't try to generalize yet. ... mulling ...
