Writing programs-as-text is different from writing prose-as-text.

For writing programs, we use
- emacs
- vim
- vscode
- grids of non-overlapping, small bitmaps
- fixed-sized fonts
- etc.

For writing prose, we use
- Word
- markdown
- Obsidian
- Scrivener
- TextEdit
- WYSIWYG
- RTF, proprietary formats, XML
- variable fonts

Are technical diagrams, intended as programs, different from paintings and art?
