[This post began as a simple emailed update, ...]

I've continued to write and post in Obsidian Publish.

But, I am trying to make the transition to producing short (<2 minute) videos/youtubes and am currently learning Descript.  This might be the best time to miss what I'm talking about, since it involves lots of learning curve and downtime on my part...

I currently think that the biggest secret I've hit on is that multitasking breaks down into 2 components (divide & conquer :-), and, that 0D is the most important of those 2 aspects (more so than even parallelism).

0D == zero dependencies (i.e. how to avoid packagage managers, make, etc.).

I'm currently working on a 2-minute video about "multitasking" (which, of course hits 0D).

I am working on making a simple script in Python.0D. To copy files, not exactly rocket science, but eating my own dogfood.  I hope to write the script also in Flyde (which I just found out about and am hoping to learn, no opinions yet, but it looks to be worth learning about (FBP-like programming in the browser))

highlights:
- syntax is cheap
- 0D
- Flyde
- multitasking
- lamgjam july 22-24, 2022 - showcase of what is possible with Ohm-JS and OCG-thinking (lessons from working with Assembler) (1) rewriting boiler-plate JS to be more JS-y, using GCC-style peephole optimization (2) Ghost Stars using Ohm-JS as a gaming-language-assembler that creates JSON ; attempt to use Descript to create a short video about this stuff ; to me "assembler" is anything that is parseable by Ohm-JS ("assembler" used to mean anything that was parseable by clunky hand-build parsers written in machine code.  Now we have better tools)
- handmade jam aug 15, 2022 - my current thinking is to build Sector Lisp in Ohm-JS, then emit C++ and Python. Sector Lisp is the most beautiful example of FP I've encountered.
- 0D using Python
- takeaways book -> youtube
- pattern-matching book -> youtube
- syntax is cheap -> orthogonal programming languages
- J.P. Morrison [RIP].

I currently think that the orthogonal programming languages technique is a stepping stone to simpler DSLs and that the OCG technique is newly re-enabled by Ohm-JS.  OCG was originally targetted at assembler. A subset of OCG-like thinking is used by GCC's RTL.  OCG is a way of dividing code generation into 2 things: (1) operators, (2) operands.  Operands (2) is what OOP is.  Operators (1) has new life breathed into it by Ohm-JS.  Operators (1) is often called "control flow", but the concept of "control flow" has been too tangled up with Operands (2), and, the "everything must be data" camp simply avoids thinking about (1).

My thinking about DaS (Diagrams as Syntax), concurrency, etc., all leads to 0D.  If you have 0D, you get composition "for free", and, you get DaS "for free", and, you get concurrency "for free", etc.

If I were to get only one sentence to sum up everything I know, it would be about 0D.  

I've been using words like "concurrency" but 0D untangles the concept.  We've been creating 0D (e.g. in processes and parallel programs) but have not been noticing the fundamental parts of parallelism and how we could concentrate on 0D without using heavy-weight technologies like operating systems.
