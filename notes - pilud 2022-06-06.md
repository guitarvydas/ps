Oh, the irony!

The premature-optimization clique convinced programmers that interpreters were "too slow" and that compilers should be used instead.

Now, 50+ years down the road, we find that premature-optimization has resulted in:
- workflows that are too slow
- Mb of bloatware
- techniques that are so complicated that they can't be explained to the majority of professional programmers (think website makers, game makers, JS crafters, etc.)
- acceptance of buggy products - programmers just ship and update weekly, forgetting Q/A

The implication is obvious:
- don't use compilers until you have designs fleshed out and fully working

Use compilers only when you need to Production Engineer a Design.

Failing that, buy a faster development system and keep complaining...
