- classes are but optimizations of prototype inheritance - any language that forces you to use classes is tailored for compilation
- I used to think Common Lisp was great until I encountered JavaScript prototypes (but, I wish JS would go back to kindergarten and learn how to count parameters and warn about too few parameters)
- sector lisp
	- 40 byte GC
	- whole language in less than 512 bytes -> pure, pure FP -> underlines difference between pure FP vs. bloatware arising from tinkering with FP paradigm
	- no need for TCO, there are simpler ways to get enough speed (partially-optimize), leave the rest of the low-level tinkering to Production Engineers
	- bytes [sic] (not K, not M, not G, not T)
- compiler building, esp, OCG (which is a superset of RTL;  RTL is used in GCC)
	- -> pattern-match, then optimize
		- peephole optimizer
		- declarative MIST
	- don't force programmers to (low-level) optimize
- stack trace = modern, politically correct phrase for "core dump"
- stack trace <- borne out of single-CPU mindset

IMO...
- stack trace <- borne out of single-CPU mindset
	- in a distributed environment, you want "tracer bullet" messages
		- and to watch what messages come into Components and what messages are generated
		- stack trace doesn't cut it - doesn't provide causality-based tracing (programmers need to rebuild the flow in their heads)
- coupling is Evil (dependencies = coupling), we need languages that allow "build and forget" (0D) instead of insisting on implicit over-synchronization
	- UNIX pipelines do this but tend to be ignored (pipelines used FIFOs, functions use LIFOs, functions calling functions are not pipelines)
	- functions are blocking State Machines and insist on under-the-hood synchronization
- inheritance is backwards - every unit of code should be completely stand-alone.  A unit's behaviour must not be altered by addition of more detail (i.e. ancestors). Harel StateCharts get this right (parent overrides child, not child overrides parent)
- operating system processes are State Machines that execute pure lambdas
	- need to use brute-force preemption to pry control of blocking away from function calls
	- lambdas should be concurrent internally 
		- not be wrapped in uber-concurrency 
		- I call this "ė"
		- each "ė" is a mini-process - a State Machine (Hierarchical) that uses a handful of pure lambdas to do the work and create deferred messages
- Distributed computing
	- eschew Loop and Recursion (these only make sense in a single-CPU mindset)
- CPU hardware supports callstack -> The Stack is a global, shared, dynamic variable
	- CALLing records a dynamic trace and mutates a global variable
	- "OK" on single CPU, but extending to distributed CPUs is asking for trouble
		- "tell" callbacks
		- "tell" node.js to override sync behaviour
		- "tell" "multitasking is a difficult problem"
			- (multi-tasking used to be simple in mid-1900s games, over-generalization and formalization created a tower of epicycles -> bloatware)
- class-based thinking is a subtle form of premature-optimization / premature-organization
	- affects how you think ("creativity")
		- sometimes good, sometimes bad
- organization is good, except for exploring a Design space
	- organization is necessary for transferring DI (Design Intent) from Architect to Architect (Maintainer, etc.)
	- but, premature-organization can limit "creativity"
	- "classes" are someone-elses' idea of how to organize code
- Objects + List-of-Objects is all that you need
	- every other type is an optimization
	- Lisp mentality for Design
		- use Lists and Atoms when creating Solutions
		- apply structs, classes, optimizations after-the-fact
		- Lisp explored "gradual typing"
			- I'm not sure if this was a successful experiment
			- too much complication <- adding stuff to a single language, everything but the kitchen sink
				- emacs is like that - too complicated
					- I've been using emacs for 40+ years and still learn something new every time I see someone else using emacs
					- too much nuance - "simplicity" == lack of nuance
- it is possible to compile Diagrams to Code
	- but, mid-1900s hand-wringing about PoC optimization, instilled a fear of anything-but-text in language developers, a bias which persists in 2022
- if I had a way of plumbing notations/paradigms together
	- would I use multiple paradigms to express the Solution to a Problem?
	- iteration - maybe I would rough-in a Design, then iterate and D&C bits of it while exploring (thinking about) the requirements
- workflow: 
	- think and tinker
	- iterate
	- divide and conquer
	- as details become more apparent, push complexity down to new lower-level
		- very Lisp-ish mentality - re-couch complex sequences as macros
- DRY
	- macros for wrapping repeated complex code
	- current: waste CPU cycles on wrapping (CALL / RETURN functions are used to dynamically (slower) wrap DRY code)
	- should be supported by IDE (editor / whatever) and not be a burden to programmers
	- ideal: show R/O code in several places, but single edit reflects changes to all places (Prototypes? Framing Software Reuse?)
- ---
- ideal <5 line code units
	- -> no need for type checking (types are "obvious" to the reader)
	- -> type stacks, type pipelines, successive refinement/checking/validation
- Diagram Macro
	- everything is a box
	- as complexity increases, lasso and push a group into a box
	- what are the rules for a box?

**observation**: Classes are but optimizations of Prototypes.

**further**...

**observation**: Inheritance is backwards.  A unit of code should be understandable in a stand-alone manner.  A "child" should not affect a "parent's" unit of code.  Instancing a "child" from a "parent" class should - in no way - alter the behaviour of the parent class.  A child must not override methods of a parent.  Conclusion: delegation, not overriding.
**observation**: Inheritance (prototype inheritance or class-based inheritance) is simply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).  A good editor should do inheritance automatically without putting the burden on Programmers (see, also, Lisp macros, Paul Bassett's [Framing Software Reuse](https://www.amazon.ca/Framing-Software-Reuse-Lessons-World/dp/013327859X ))
**observation** Harel StateCharts conquer the "state explosion problem" by using delegation and encapsulation.  Harel StateCharts use delegation instead of inheritance (a "good thing" IMO).  My take on the original [StateChart paper](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2020/12/09/StateCharts.html)
**observation** Sector Lisp - I used to hate FP, but Sector Lisp convinced me that FP can be beautiful and small.  Why is Sector Lisp many, many orders of magnitude smaller than other Programming Languages and Operating Systems?  IMO: Sector Lisp stays within the "sweet spot" of the FP paradigm and doesn't try to be an all-in-one solution to every programming problem.
**observation** Sector Lisp's Garbage Collector (invented by Tunney) is 40 bytes.  SIC: bytes, not K, not M, not G, not T.
**opinion** Sector Lisp's smallness cannot be due only to Assembler Parlour Tricks.  Something deeper must be involved.
**opinion** We need languages that plumb "build and forget" solutions.  Plumbing ≣ composition.  UNIX pipelines are an example of this.  Surely, we can do better.
**observation** Functions employ LIFOs, UNIX pipelines employ FIFOs.
**observation** Functions calling funtions cannot be pipelines (LIFO vs FIFO)
