Trying to organize something 
- inhibits creativity
- cause self-editing
## Emacs Org Mode

Insists that you organize thoughts hierarchically.

## Obsidian
Supposedly allows you to make a pool of tagged thoughts.

Adding tags causes self-editing and inhibits creativity.

Add tags after-the-fact.

## Scapple
Unlike mind-mapping tools, allows you scribble thoughts down.

Just about nothing is lost.  You can write a thought down without figuring out where to put it.

Allows after-the-fact organization.  E.g. create lines between thoughts.  Drag one thought bubble over another to create a link, without imposing a directionality.

Does not allow lassoing thoughts and pushing them to another diagram.  Easily.
