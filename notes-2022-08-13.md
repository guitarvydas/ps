  
FoC -> use Dynamic Languages for generating ideas (use Lisp, Smalltalk, etc.)

PoC -> (Present of Coding) -> use Static Languages for optimization of FoC ideas (use Python, Rust, Haskell, C, etc.)

Divide-and-conquer applied to Programming…
1. Develop Ideas, Implement and Explore and Debug Ideas (FoC)
2. Production Engineer to optimize step (1) to run on cheaper hardware (PoC) (PoC ≣ Present of Coding)

1 => use "dynamic languages" to explore FoC ideas (e.g. Lisp, Smalltalk, etc.)
2 => use “static languages" to optimize ideas (e.g. Python, Haskell, Rust, etc.)
[Yes, writing the Code twice is more efficient than writing it only once in a PoC language].
