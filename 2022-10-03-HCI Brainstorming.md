- observation: The metaphors of "Desktop" and "Files" are old in the tooth, and, based on old ways of doing things before computers existed (1940s?). We need to replace the old metaphors with something more suited to computers.
- observation: "trees" are an invention of academics attempting to flatten complex concepts to fit their media (clay tablets and paper).  Normal people think in terms of nested boxes.  Up until now, our media prevented us from conveniently displaying nested boxes.  (I argue that the problem of "global variables" is due to programming using text instead of drawings of boxes).
- observation: Computer Keyboards are better for developers than mice (10 fingers vs. one arm+hand)
- observation: Computer Keyboards are better than piano keyboards for music (no arm movement).  Wanted: computer keyboard with velocity sensitive keys that can sense nuance by wiggling.
- opinion: Zoom is too imprecise.  I'm an Engineer and I vant precision. Inertial scrolling is too sloppy.  Smooth zoom is too sloppy.
- observation: A bus in electronics is just zoomed-in detail of a connection.
- observation: λ-calculus has discovered that names are superfluous. I add that ALL syntax is superfluous.  Paradigms are important, syntax is simply sugar-coating.
- observation: Files in a directory could be represented by a bunch of zoomable boxes, instead of text.
- observation: A "box" in ASCII art is `{...}`
- observation: `fn(x,y,z)` -- x,y,z is ONE parameter (one block of data in time), but deconstructed using ASCII into separate sub-data
- observation: (lambda (...) ... ) is ASCII zooming (`fn(...)` is zoom-out `(lambda (...) ...)` is zoom-in)
- other technologies, not directly related, but maybe of interest: 
	- https://git.sr.ht/~akkartik/pensieve.love 
	- unrelated, but related: Knotend mouseless flowcharts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y56TwNTxB3w
		- uses TAB key to snap between nodes (boxes)
		- various other kbd bindings for inserting nodes
	- infinite canvas: https://infinitecanvas.tools
- wanted: zoomable whiteboard
- thought: I like Knotend, except (on the surface) that it seems to deal with only 1 input and 1 output.  Can zooming-in on a join point reveal detail/destructuring?
- ATM, I am on a layering kick.  Every concept can be broken down ("divide and conquer", "fractal") and studied more deeply. Precise zoom (snap-zoom?) might be a way to present layers.
- opinion: (1) wanted: a toolbox of commands and assets (files, peripherals, etc), (2) various GUIs for presenting different Views on the toolbox - visual shell, audio shell, zoom, etc, etc. (e.g. deprecate operating systems and programming languages, replace them with software LEGO® blocks (implies async, not sync, software units, hence, my interest in 0D[^0d])) 
- I use Scapple and Kinopio.  Scapple's biggest advantage is that it asks no questions until later.  Low friction UX.  Slap ideas down quickly without friction.  Most other mind-mapping software begins with friction, e.g. "what kind of mind-map do you want?", "where do you want to save this?".  Kinopio is, also, low-friction.
