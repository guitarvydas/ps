FYI, to me, .md maps to .html and restricts what is possible (in sensible ways). 

Are you aware of UNIX PIC? https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix3/unixnut/ch17_03.htm ?  I didn't dig into it, yet it appealed to me.  I guess that GraphViz might supercede it (but a lot of people (ahem, gnu) didn't get the UNIX concepts).  

Options should *not* be presented to users.  

An assembler makes *everything* possible.  

A language (SCN) *restricts* what is possible and provides a UX.  

There are many useful UXs for any given problem space.  

An SCN ("language") should *not* do everything, but it *should* provide useful restrictions.  

A user should not be forced to use only *one* UX for a problem.

Too much generalization kills utility.

The more rules that I have to remember, the less likely I am to use the system.

General Purpose Programming Languages are the antithesis of useful UXs.
