Typora and Obsidian have warts and one /has/ to break down and use low-level markdown to get around the warts, 
- but, the warts are only symptoms of the mind-virus. 

I see HTML as "assembler" and markdown as the next level up (.md is an HLL, like C :-). 

Likewise, HTML + SVG is a bunch of ad-hoc assembler that needs to be organized and simplified.

For something practical, connections are a nightmare in text.

Text is "assembler", editor is graphical and spews out assembler ; assembler can be viewed by keeners who like to read core-dumps.

Case: no one voluntarily writes markdown if they have Typora or Obsidian live-edit. But, they want to know that, in emergencies, their data can be read by other tools (existing), and, they want to write data-manglers in -say- JS.
