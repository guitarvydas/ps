Emacs is an editor that is grid-based and does not allow overlapping of cells. 

We had to invent Unicode, to allow restricted forms of overlapping which still does not use our 2020's hardware to its full potential. [[PLATO]]

Text editing and text programming languages are based on the restrictions of 1950's hardware... 70 years later, and, we are still designing languages like we did in 1950.
