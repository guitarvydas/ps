- design
	- not Production Engineering
- songwriting
	- yes, and ...
- improv
	- yes, and ...
- exploring design space
	- cannot know the solution before you know the problem
	- need to explore, figure out, poke-at the problem
	- spec <- spec can only be written after the problem-space has been understood
		- Waterfall â‰£ premature belief that the problem-space is fully understood
- how to change your mind?
	- if you discover a new aspect of the problem space
		- are you constrained by your tool(s) to ignore the new aspect
			- C programming is like that
			- synchronous programming is like that
				- fragile, change something -> breaks in unexpected place(s)
			- wanted: "build and forget", no changes in other parts of the system can affect previously built program -> 0D
- anti-academic
	- academics are taught to "finish" a project before displaying it
	- brainstorming is the opposite:
		- talk about intermediate work
		- "show your work for partial marks" grade school
		- conferences and working papers are more like brainstorming
- premature design is like premature optimization, but worse
	- if a premature design is calcified as unchageable code, then -> garbage out
- need to know that you can discard existing code
	- Lisp allows rewriting the whole code base
	- early BASICs, etc., kept programs small an had a low barrier to rewriting
	- [[Build and Forget]]
