- are you debugging code? or, 
- are you debugging design?

It would be best to build perfect code without the need for debugging.
	- What tools exist/could-exist that could help create perfect code?
	- What tools exist/could-exist that could help create perfect designs?

If tools don't exist, then
- is a debugger-for-design different from a debugger-for-code?

Can we build perfect code from a design spec?
	- in which case, is debugging *only* for design?
