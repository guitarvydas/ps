Thinking out loud (half-baked...):
1. The big win in Ohm-Editor is that it is a REPL.  You can see results immediately and tweak code on-the-fly.  What other REPLs exist?  Lisp.  Smalltalk.  /bin/sh.  Spreadsheets. (How do Python, node.js, repl-it stack up?)
2. The big win in Ohm is that you can concentrate ONLY on the grammar, while ignoring all of the other niggly details.
3. The big win in PEG is that you can describe recursive parsers.  Parsers, not languages.  This, alone, enables a completely different way of thinking about language design.  Incremental instead of all-in-one.
4. Aside: What is the message from Worry-Dream?  Non-textual programming languages and REPLs.
5. Aside: Dynamic languages make REPLs easy.  Static languages and compiler-appeasement languages make REPLs harder than necessary.
6. Q: Is it possible to marry a REPL with a text-only-editor?
7. Opinion: Programming languages are IDEs for programming (but, very limiting IDEs, IMO).
8. Opinion: The act of Programming consists of many, very-different ativities.  Trying to unify all of the different activities into one tool is tough (probably impossible).  A real project breaks down ("divide and conquer") into many sub-problems.  Each sub-problem is best described with a unique notation (a "DSL", or "SCN" as I call it).  Parsing is one such unique activity.  Parsing is simply "pattern matching".  Aside: REGEXP is a stunted form of pattern-matching that has ugly SCN (DSL) syntaxes (1 syntax for matching, 1 syntax for doing).  Once you match input text, the question arises "what to do with the matches?".  The SCN used to describe the matcher is not suitable for describing "what to do".  Ohm-JS shows one solution to these problems - (1) use an SCN to describe the matching process, (2) use a general-purpose programming language, JavaScript in this case, to describe what-to-do after the matching process has successfully destructured the input text.
9. Opinion: Conclusion: We don't need to integrate Ohm-Editor into a general text-only-editor.  We need an IDE that allows one to edit text using any text-only editor, and, fires up Ohm-Editor after every save.  Maybe a pattern-match that peels the grammar out of the text (probably written in Ohm :-) and shoves it into a waiting Ohm-Editor browser.  Likewise, it might peel test cases out of the text and feed them into the "Examples" window of Ohm-Editor.  Likewise, some options like "show spaces", "explain parse", "start rule", etc., etc.  Emacs' "org-mode" is a step in that direction.  It uses a goofy syntax to delineate sections of text and code and results.  Kinda like markdown. Emacs' downfall is that it starts with a text-only mentality and tries to convert all problems into text-only problems.
10. Conclusion: start small, by (1) creating an Ohm-Editor server to which you can send grammar and test snippets.  Then, (2), create a file-watcher program/daemon that periodically reads files from the client-side disk and shoots their contents at the Ohm-Editor server (auto-uploader?).  I.E. make a REPL web-server.  The BREPL (browser-based REPL) inputs text, fires up a server-side processor app, displays the results.

Evolving thoughts: I want a REPL.  REPLs used to be all-in-one affairs.  Can we re-chunk them using more modern technology?  E.G. a browser REPL is configured to listen for commands ("eval", "change options", "memo this as X", "memo this as Y", etc.).  When the server gets an "eval" command, it pulls the memo'ed items and sends them as input to a server-side app.  The app processes the items and sends back an HTML response to the browser.  On the client-side, one-or-more daemons are configured to watch certain files and fire them up to the REPL server when they are changed.  Concrete example: Ohm-Editor has several input areas: (1) the source grammar, (2) one or more test snippets, (3) display options, (4) eval options (like which start rule of the grammar to use).  Ohm-Editor displays the parse tree, if parsing is successful, or, it displays

I strongly disagree with the details.  We built poor IDEs for programming based on 1950's hardware realities, e.g. we programmed using only grids of non-overlapping, small bitmaps.  We still use those 1950's biases.  All programming languages are the same - they are LIFO-based and provide pervasive synchronization even when we don't want it.  UNIX /bin/sh was loved because it used FIFOs.  Programmers continue to be inconvenienced with hardware appeasement languages.  We need Structured Message Passing instead.

Is there a FAQ for using Parallels for Mac+Linux?

I ask before diving into the manuals...

I want to develop software using Linux, using my home directory on Mac and have it backed up with Time Machine.  I.E. all source files on Mac, but, tools from Linux (e.g. emacs, Python3, etc.)).  I want to use the Mac for desktop apps like Mail, Calendar, Scapple, Obsidian, iMovie, GitKraken, etc.

I haven't read the Parallels manuals yet, simply installed Parallels (evaluation) and Ubuntu.  Time Machine is failing and I don't know how to share files yet.  Ideally, I want a quick setup, then learn details slowly over time.  For now, I've had to quit Parallels until I learn more.

Strongly Disagree.  Programmers are saddled with poor DEs for programming based on 1950's hardware realities - grids of non-overlapping, small bitmaps.  All programming languages are the same - compiler appeasement, LIFO-based, pervasive synchronization.  UNIX /bin/sh uses FIFOs, 0D (zero (implicit) dependencies), no implicit sync.

MIA: Structured Message Passing.
