struggle for explaining concepts
- nothing new, just rearranging deck chairs

- Factorial
- Diagrams
- 0D
- Inverse Inheritance
- Async vs. Sync
- Sector Lisp, Smallness, Bloatware
- 2 kinds of problem
- 2 kinds of Component
	- not 1
- stacks vs queues (LIFOs vs FIFOs, callstack)
- Isolation
	- every diagram / piece of code stands on its own and cannot be affected by other pieces
- question: TTL hardware was async, but designs worked, whereas software leads to brittle designs
	- gearboxes
	- culture of upgrade
	- sync resists human understanding, free will
- simplicity
	- lack of nuance
	- parameters == bad
- no 1 language to rule them all
	- multiple languages per project
	- need a way to join disparate languages into single project
- coordination language
	- too weak
	- needs to be 1st class
		- like functions - when raised to 1st class, new vistas opened up (programmer UX? freedom to think)
- Dynamic vs. Static Languages
- Structure Editing
	- bad
	- symptom of "1 language to rule them all"-thinking
	- KISS
		- editor edit
		- checkers check (e.g. lint)
		- code emitters emit, transpile
- sync / text invented in mid-1900s
	- biased due to technology
	- mathematics notation invented for clay tablets and paper
		- mathematics is 2 things
		1. notation
		2. thinking
		- redirect thinking into new notations
		- thinking can't be replaced, but notation can
	- computers offer new ways to express multi-dimensional problems
		- sync was invented to analyze single-CPU problems
		- now, though, we have distributed problems
			- time for a notation change/upgrade
			- not good enough to "model" behaviour in single-CPU notation
- ASON
- DALL-E

- Descript
	- make linear editing Audio and Video more accessible by completely revamping the paradigm
- Bicycles for the Mind
	- Kasparov uses computers to augment chess decisions
- Erlang, Actors
	- implemented using sync tech
	- faked out async
	- could be much simpler
- Smalltalk
	- doesn't do message passing (!)
	- methods are implemented as sync
- model: 2 rPIs connnected by 2 1-way wires
	- allowing bi-directional wires is an optimization
- Abstraction
	- lasso group of components, move off-page, replace with 1 component with fewer Ports
	- fan-out, fan-in
- electronics is async at base
	- sync was human invention
	- Motorola CPUs vs Zilog CPUs
- functions follow blocking protocol
	- waiting for result from callee (call return) is blocking
	- interferes with O/S control of blocking
	- makes brittle gearboxes, change "here", unexpected effect "there" (whack-a-mole)
- scalability
	- organize as tree (not graph)
	- biz ORG charts
	- optimized code <- reorganized to share structure <- can't be scaled
- DRY
	- --> schizophrenia in OO
		- inherit for semantic reasons?
		- inherit to share code?
	- --> inefficient use of functions at runtime for containment of code
		- containment could easily be macro expansion by editor, not CPU
		- e.g. 
		```
		function xyz (...) { ... }
		function 
			- 
```
