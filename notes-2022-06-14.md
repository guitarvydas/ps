for coordination: Arvydas is playing Golf in Creemore on Thursday, also.  I want to email him today, inviting him to stay at the cottage if he doesn't want to drive home that night.  The invitation would include Vida (since they might want to go to their cottage the next day).  I don't know what, if anything, is planned for Mom or Vida.  Does this pose any conflicts with what you might have told Vida/Mom?  I doubt he will accept, but you never know... (Do we have acceptable beds up there?)

The /current/ plan is: drive up to cottage in daylight on Wednesday.  Be at the golf course 1-2 hours early (2:30 tee-off).  Drive back to cottage after the game, come home on Friday.  I might need to cut the grass up there on Wed afternoon or Friday.

Possibilities I haven't considered: (a) Drive up to cottage Thursday morning, come back Friday. (b) Drive up and back with Arvydas on Thursday, don't cut grass.  I like to be at the course very early, Arvydas likes to be there at the last moment. (c) See who else is going from this area and maybe get a ride with them.

Ideally, by default, I would want the car Wed/Thursday/Friday.

Is getting a rental car a PITA?  That will affect my thinking about plans...

Are you planning on driving up to Mad River and back to Toronto on Thursday?

My plans have changed and I'm looking for a ride.  I haven't asked anyone else yet...

We are down to one car and if I don't need it, I can leave it for Lukas to use.
