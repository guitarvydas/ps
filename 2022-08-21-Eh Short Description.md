# Ä— - Goal and Overview

The goal of this project is to program computers using pluggable units of software.

To do this we need:
- micro-concurrency
- 0D
- layers, relative sofware units
- multiple languages.

## Hello World 
Very simple example
## Leaf
![[hello world eh-Leaf.png]]

## Container
![[hello world eh-helloworld.png|400]] 

## Re-Architecting
![[hello world eh-helloworldworld.png|400]]
## Scalability
Pluggability is necessary for scalability, but, more elaborate (complicated) examples would be needed.

# Benefits
- anti-bloatware
- technical drawings come "for free"
- concurrency comes "for free"
- "build and forget" development
- distributed programming comes "for free"
- multiple-CPU paradigm
- ability to plug together software components to create mimimal set of functionality
