synthesis

O/S
different O/Ss for different use-cases
	- 1 O/S for end-users
	- 1 O/S for developers
- layers
- use components built by others
	- we think that we're doing this by using Libraries, but pervasive sync is causing epicycles
- 2 ways to intercommunicate
		- LIFO (stacks, functions)
		- FIFO (queues, 0D, inter-process)
- testability
- Production Engineering
- invert inheritance
- cannot rewrite everything
	- can we rewrite bits only?
- distributed processing
	- remove implicit sync
	- expunge Loop, Recursion
	- blockchain
		- treat everything as a state machine
- CSM
- Processes (e.g. UNIX commands) give 0D
	- offends me == bloatware
- build and forget

- plug components together
	- using pervasive sync leads to bloatware and difficulty
	- break pervasive sync (LIFO), use async (FIFO)

This project aims to solve code bloat in operating systems, obviating the need for traditional operating systems.

We can't throw away exising software, so this project proposes an incremental approach.

This project builds software components as decoupled (0D) units.  Developers can mix and match components to deliver stripped-down applications to end users.

Component-based, 0D, software is becoming more important as applications become more distributed - robotics, blockchain, internet, IoT, etc.  Traditional operating systems tend to make software development for distributed apps more difficult and increasingly complicated.  Solutions, involving increasing complexity, e.g. "monads", are essentially inaccessible to software practitioners.

# Discussion

## Mix and Match Software Components
Various Linux distros try to give developers the option to choose what components to include in a build of the operating system.  A high degree of technical knowledge is required to tweak such options, making this approach unpalatable to most software practitioners

Commercial operating systems like Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS reduce the option space for end-users by bundling just about everything into swelling products.

Visual Programming approaches, Node Red, etc., have been tried but tend to fail and/or become too complicated to use.

USB.  A bus "standard" was invented to enable "Plug'N'Play" peripherals.  This standard suffers from the *unioning* problem and its complexity increases over time.  USB is used for hardware devices, but is not, in general, used as a way to mix-and-match software components.

APIs.  APIs attempt to restrict the interfaces between software components.  Each API is wildly different and fairly complicated (due to the use of many kinds of Types for API parameters).

ROS.  Robot Operating Systems are just "more of the same".  Such operating systems pile epicycles onto existing software in efforts to bend old-style operating systems for modern uses.

os invented in 1900s do not relate to modern concerns such as distributed computing (and, even, games containing autonomous agents)

node.js, callbacks, preemption, etc. - tells that something is wrong in the low-level substrate

coupling - synchrony

DaS - free with 0D
multitasking - free with 0D

1. understand what is needed, use divide and conquer, not one-size-fits-all
	- conclusion: over-use of sync
	- humans understand async, are stymied when they need to think in terms of pervasive sync
2. synthesize
