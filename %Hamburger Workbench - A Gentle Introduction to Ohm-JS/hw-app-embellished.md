In this sub-step, we get bold and embellish the grammar to include options - "Mustard", "Ketchup", "Pickles", "Special Sauce", "Cheese", "Bacon".  The "Special Sauce" option can contain any number of spaces between the two words (in fact, if there are no spaces, the pattern match will succeed anyway.  You can prevent this kind of no-spaces matching if you want to, later, when you learn more about Ohm-JS.)
