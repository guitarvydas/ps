observation: The metaphors of "Desktop" and "Files" are old in the tooth and based on old ways of doing things before computers existed (1940s?)

observation: "trees" are an invention of academics attempting to flatten complex concepts to fit their media (clay tablets and paper).  Normal people think in terms of nested boxes.  Up until now, our media prevented us from conveniently displaying nested boxes.  (I argue that the problem of "global variables" is due to the use of text instead of drawings of boxes).
