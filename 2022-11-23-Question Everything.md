  
Hmmm, it seems that my main approach is to “question everything”

Robert Distinti says “humans get everything wrong the first time”[^para].

[^para]: Paraphrased by me.

That kind of thinking leads to a bizarre thread: what if Evolution is wrong?  What if Evolution doesn’t mean that humans descended from apes, but that bacteria descended from Humans?

- Do bacteria exhibit intelligent behaviour?  Yes.  [Group Behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXWurAmtf78)
- How do you optimize human behavior - The Borg.  
	- Is there an example of Borg-like behavior in nature?
		- Yes: Bees and beehives.
- Giants
	- Did giants exist? 
	- Is Homo Sapiens an "optimized" form of giants?
- Sediment - Archaelogy
	- history is covered-over by layers of sediment
	- Where did that sediment come from?
		- I haven't done a volume calculation to see if prehistoric mountain ranges being ground down by Ice Age glaciers can account for the volume of stuff covering history
	- Distinti is concluding that matter sucks.  Literally.  In his theories, matter continues to exist only by the fact that it is continually ingesting aether.
	- Was the Earth smaller, earlier?
		- Did Earth create create/suck new layers of sedminent on top of itself?
	- Were big animal (dinosaurs) enabled by less-gravity?
