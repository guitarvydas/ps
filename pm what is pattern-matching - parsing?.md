Pattern-matching is a paradigm.

Pattern-matching is like other paradigms, say GC (Garbage Collection), or, Object-Oriented Programming, or, Functional Programming, etc.

Like other paradigms, programmers create code to match patterns every day.  Programmers can benefit from learning techniques for doing so.

Programmers can benefit from using DSL's, SCN's and tools for pattern-matching.   A DSL is a Domain Specific Language.  

This book will introduce one such DSL for pattern-matching, called Ohm-JS.  

An SCN (Solution Centric Notation) is like a DSL (Domain Specific Language), expect more specific.  Knowing how to sling the pattern-matching paradigm around, allows programmers to think differently about how to solve problems.  I've coined the term *SCN* to describe a new way of looking at programming using multiple mini-languages.

Historically, *parsing* has been associated with compiler design.  Parsing is just a subset of the pattern-matching paradigm.

Compilers are programs that need to use the pattern-matching paradigm.  When used for building a compiler program, pattern-matching is called "parsing".  

Programmers can use the pattern-matching paradigm in non-compiler apps.
