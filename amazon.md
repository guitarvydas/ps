Amazon.ca dumped gargbage on my doorstep and refuses to take responsibility for this.

I would like my elected officials to deal with Amazon on my behalf and to prevent this from ever happening again.

Details:

I ordered 3 jugs of popcorn.

When the order arrived in a cardboard box on my doorstep, one of the jugs was opened and spilled 2/3 of its contents into the box and onto my doorstep.  September 18.

The jugs have screw-on lids.  The lid could not have simply fallen off in transit and must have been unscrewed by someone at Amazon or by one of Amazon's agents.

Amazon refuses to come over and clean up the remains.   Amazon is offering me a refund and a gift card. Neither of which cover my costs - (1) my time for dealing with this mistake, and, (2) cleaning staff indemnified by Amazon. 

I am not employed by Amazon.ca and do not expect to help Amazon.ca deal with this mistake.

I, and my wife, are 67 and retired.  I do not indemnify Amazon for any medical expenses arising from this mistake.

Details:

I ordered 3 jugs of popcorn.  

When the order arrived in a cardboard box on my doorstep, one of the jugs was opened and spilled 2/3 of its contents into the box and onto my doorstep.  September 18.  Roughly 2 kg of loose kernels.

The jugs have screw-on lids.  The lid could not have simply fallen off in transit and must have been unscrewed by someone at Amazon or by one of Amazon's agents before the box was taped shut.

Amazon refuses to come over to take away the garbage.  Instead, Amazon expects me to deal with the problem they created, and, has offered me a refund and a gift card for a small amount.

I am not employed by Amazon.ca and do not expect to have to help Amazon.ca deal with this problem.

Simply moving the box and trying to throw it in the garbage will spill more popcorn and create more headaches for me.

Amazon collects a healthy profit from me on successful deliveries but is not taking responsibility for this unsuccessful delivery.
