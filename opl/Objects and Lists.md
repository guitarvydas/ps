Lessons about encapsulation:
- encapsulate data
- bundle all data operations with data
- no knowledge of structure in users-of-data

Is a List an object?
- at lowest-level, yes (assembler like level)
- for UX, no, people think of lists-of-things, not lists that are objects

What is the solution?
- treat low-level lists as Objects, completely encapsulated
- treat UX versions of lists as people-oriented lists of Objects, not as Objects themselves
