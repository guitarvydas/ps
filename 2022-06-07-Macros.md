The power of macros is that they give you a way to write programs that write programs.

Until PEG came along, Lisp was the easiest way to write programs-that-write-programs.

(That's not quite true, but let's not confuse the issue with facts.  S/SL and TXL can do PEG-like things, but PEG is more "popular").

Compilers are programs that write programs, but, we call them "compilers" instead of macros.  And, compilers tend not to work recursively.  

You input a file of text, the compiler outputs a file of assembler (or binary).

In Lisp, if a program rewrites code that contains another macro, the macro processor keeps chugging along, diving in doing rewrites until there are no more macro calls remaining.

Lisp, like assembler, has a very regular syntax, and, because Lisp is expression-based, you can join bits of generated Lisp into bigger bits of generated Lisp - easily.  It's so easy, even a machine can do it.

The Lisp reader converts input text into Lisp lists.  Once source code has been converted to list form, you get to use *any* Lisp function to hack on the source code (ahem, list).

If only you could hack on text files as easily as that ...

With the advent of PEG - I like Ohm-JS even better than PEG - you *can* hack on text files easily. Currently, I hack on source code using *any* function supplied by the Javascript language.  Javascript has a lot of string-hacking functions like .replace(), regex matching, etc., etc.  I don't need Lisp's list-hacking functions, since I'm not hacking on lists, I'm hacking on text.  I even wrote myself a small command-line utility (you'll never guess - in Ohm-JS), to help me hack.  It works like Lisp macros but on text instead of on lists.  It's like `sed` on steroids (PEG is better than REGEX, Ohm-JS is better than PEG.  `sed` uses REGEX).

The remaining difference is that the Lisp macro processor is built into the Lisp compiler, whereas I need to set up a pipeline to use Ohm-JS in the same way.  Pipelines are easy, but they're not built into the compiler.

At the moment, I have to store generated code somewhere, maybe in a disk file or maybe in a pipeline.  In Lisp, the generated code is hidden from you and the compiler knows where to look, so you don't need to worry about it.  (If you really, really, really want to know, think lists.  It's obvious.  All source code is lists, the compiler knows how to grok source-code-as-lists, macros read lists and generate new lists...)

Another way to say what I've already said: The stumbling block to writing programs that write programs in languages other than Lisp and assembler, is the fact that the other languages have syntax which gets in the way and complicates code-reading and code-generation.

The other problem is the word "parser".  People think that parsers are *only* used in compilers.

But, REGEXs were invented for compilers, too.  Ever since Perl, though, "REGEX" has become a household word.

PEG is in the same class as REGEX.  PEG is just a pattern-matcher technology.  PEG lets you specify matches that can't be specified using Language Theory.

Lisp allows you to use the YAGNI principle.  You write "just enough" of a parser to do the job you need done.

PEG allows you to use the YAGNI principle.

Language Theory is anti-YAGNI.  You have to specify the whole enchilada.  You can't just sprinkle CFG grammars into a program like you can with REGEXs. 

With easy-to-use parsing, the syntax-based problems go away.  If Javascript had built-in PEG parsing instead of REGEXs, you'd have the power of macros.

## More Detail...
Assembler lends itself to machine-generated code.  Assembler has "no syntax".  Assembler is straight-forward and "normalized".  It is "easy" to write programs that write assembler because assembler poses few hurdles for doing this.

Lisp is a lot like assembler.  Lisp has "no syntax" - everything in Lisp is a prefix expression.

In assembler, you write
```
ADD R0,2
```

In Lisp, you write
```
(add x 2)
```
(actually, that's not quite correct, but let's not complicate things with the details)
