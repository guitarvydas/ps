- threads are bloatware, threads are epicycles
- syntax is frivolous, paradigms are essential
- deprecate programming languages
- deprecate operating systems
- synchrony is a programming tactic, not a fundamental Law
- normal people understand scalability (business ORG Charts)
- normal people understand diagrams, they use whiteboards daily
- normal people use concurrency daily ("while the potatoes cook, chop up ...")
- 5 year olds are taught hard realtime notation daily
- The Goal is to Control Computers, not to buff programming languages.
- Multi-tasking does *not* mean *isolation* between components.  Isolation is a feature of multi-purpose operating systems like Linux, Windows and MacOS. (When debugging, one wants maximum *isolation*, but, in a production-Engineered product we might strip *isolation* to get speed and cheaper hardware.)
- dynamic changes at runtime is bad
- `Prep` is a computerized tool for (re)writing programs.
- concurrency is a lifestyle, parallelism is a greasy hamburger
- sometimes you must have a greasy hamburger, but not always
- Design and Optimization don't mix
- Diagrams for Software: rectangles, ellipses, line, text (stripped-down SVG?)
- we use textual notations because of premature optimization for space on a piece of paper
- the most beautiful program in the world is only beautiful to those who like to think textually
- I like to think that every operation must be bound to a keystroke.
- A mouse requires a whole hand, a keyboard allows the use of 10 fingers.
- A beautiful textual program can be made more beautiful by drawing it as a diagram.
- Beautiful Software Architecture is more beautiful than beautiful Software Code.
- Code is optimized Software Architecture.
- Code hides Software Architecture.
- Zooming can fit anything onto a T-Shirt.  ASCII Art is primitive zooming.
- FP contains State, but hides it on The Stack.
- We had to discover scoping because we were using ASCII Art for programs.
- Software Architecture is not Software Code
- If it doesn't fit on a T-shirt, zoom out
- history of Programming Language Design: using ASCII Art to zoom out
- if it doesn't fit on a T-shirt, zoom out ; programming language == ASCII Art for zooming out (`{ ... }` means "box")
- sync is a subset of async
- Q: Which camera angle do you zoom out from? A: It doesn't matter, but, don't assume that there is one and only one camera angle.
- If it fits on a T-shirt, ask for a layout diagram of the chip.
- Q: How did we conquer global variables? A: Scoping. Q: What is scoping? A: Drawing a box around a bunch of code.
- Inheritance is zoomed-out COPY/PASTE.
- text editors edit textual "assembler" ; modern PLs provide various HLL syntaxes for textual assemblers
- What is the "assembly language" for DaS (diagrams as syntax)? SVG?
- Assembly language for types ... <ref to github>
