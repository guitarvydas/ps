Here are some "first impressions" (sometimes, first impressions are quite instructive, since they contain unfiltered truth):

a) the youtube has the right-hand-side cropped out on my video (resolution problem on my end?)
b) I don't see multiple input ports and wonder about multiple output ports
c) abstraction: abstraction can be a UX issue, a good diagram tool needs to allow abstraction where the number of ports can be reduced.  This implies fan-out (something which JPM detested).

I tried to write down an answer(s) to your original question (Why Hasn't FBP Caught On?), which veered into more detail.  HTH...

and, just about anything labelled 2022-07-11-... 

(the ...-12-... and ...-13-... stuff doesn't talk directly to your question, but swirls around programming in small pieces, which is kinda related to the whole Component-Based Programming issue...  (N.B. I don't always finish/edit my essays, I believe in brainstorming and "showing my intermediate work" which often results in writing that is not as presentable as academic papers))

cool: Your UI shows ports only when you hover over a component.  I grew up on EE schematics, where ports are always visible.  Your way might leave less syntactic sugar / clutter on the diagram.  I think that less clutter is a Good Thing.  I wonder if there is a use-case for showing all of the ports all of the time (a toggle?), or, if this kind of thinking is just a rut I'm in ...  pondering.

tangent: I favour having exactly one input FIFO and exactly one output FIFO per component.  JPM's FBP has one queue for every port.  Of course, I think that my way is better, but I can't be specific ....

tangent: A good editor tool provides "shortcuts" (Lispers know this as "macros", Apple calls this "keyboard shortcuts").  A *lot* of stuff can be done with macros.  For example, one might be able to implement fan-out with macros (the reason why I build fan-out into my notation is a bias - explicit fan-out parts can lead to noisy diagrams, if you insist on showing the fan-out parts) 

tangent: mathematics breaks down into 2 parts: (1) notation, and, (2) thinking.  Mathematics notation (1) is just a bunch of rules for textual cut-and-paste.  Microsoft Word can do that ("search and replace").  The "no mutation" rule stems from the fact that cut-and-paste at a textual level only works if you prohibit dirty text (0D again!).  Mathematics notation is based on clay-tablet technology (2D).  I have to wonder whether we are breaking out of 2D-only presentations (x,y) into 3D presentations ((x,y,t), for example).  Mathematics notation doesn't handle (t) very well (it's not impossible, but it's not conducive to out-of-the-box-thinking).  Rhetorical question: Is CBP a taste of (x,y,t) thinking?  (CBP == Component Based Programming, a superset of FBP (?)).  Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogene railed against functional-thinking and claimed that it had set Physics back by 100 years (book: "Order Out Of Chaos"). Maxwell's Equations flatten 4D phenomena (x,y,z,t) to 2D (x,y) and "we" have forgotten that this is but a convenience and cannot describe reality fully.

tangent: I think that a good editor should edit only.  You should be able to create illegal "code".  Emacs lets you do this (you can put characters in the wrong order, emacs doesn't care about what language you are editing).  I have seen "semantics based editors" fail because they knew too much about the underlying structure.  Hence, my interest in parsing diagrams...

---

tangent: Danger zone: being so full of oneself to think that one's notation is "the best".  There are many notations, each with a targetted purpose.  There can be no "one language to rule them all".

use-case: generate JavaScript programs from your diagrams (use the result in any browser) ; this happens to be what I'm working on right now :-) (In fact, I'm generating Python - a lot harder than generating JS because of the stupid syntax indentation of Python).  Treat all existing PLs as assembler, transpile down to them.

aside: we got IBM Canada to pay us to consult for them for a couple of months on component-based software.  We had them convinced that they could sell guaranteed components in a repository, then they re-orged and Visual Age Smalltalk came out and they forgot about us (big company vs. small company issues, we needed to get income every month, they had a large pool of $'s and weren't thinking that way)

aside: how did you find me?  I was assuming that you came from the FBP discord ...

I think: forget "current" programmers.  Look for early adopters in emerging markets (robotics, IoT, etc).  I'm off to golf now, and will continue mulling and will comment further if the mulling goes somewhere.  "Current" programmers are too set in their ways and think that they know how to solve every problem.  That is, also, the crux of the FBP marketing problem.

 bit.dev: hmm, no I haven't heard about them, but, then I got disillusioned and stopped looking at more-of-the-same attempts to build async programming on top of sync programming.  I'll have a look tonight, and will read any synopsis you feel like giving me.

My opinion: there are big wins available, but the current crop of programmers won't understand them.  Hobbyists might.  I have looked at Sector Lisp and found big wins there - 40 byte [sic, byte, not K, not M, not G] garbage collector and really-really-pure FP (the whole language fits in less than 512 bytes).  Likewise, I think that atomic concurrency is O(10 bytes), yet everyone else thinks we need to use bloatware like Linux/Windows/MacOS and stuff this bloatware onto rPIs.  Other: I was deeply influenced by Harel's Statecharts paper (1986).  It shows that programming can be done with something other than text.  I have recorded a Papers We Love talk about it...

Can I try Flyde?

---

Aside: I'm currently using draw.io and converting its output to JSON.  Then, converting the JSON to Python (I think I did JS, too).  The transpiler currently uses PROLOG to parse the diagrams and to understand the diagrams as Components (but, it could use anything else, like JS or Python or Clojure or miniKanren or ...).  I'd be glad to explain, if that interests you.  I'm trying to eat my own dogfood by using it to write a simple copy/modify script for the chapters of my books (Obsidian to Leanpub re-formatting).  It would be wonderful to bolt the Flyde editor onto the diagram transpiler and to use something less hostile for diagram editing than draw.io.

---

Aside: For giggles, I inverted functions so that functions are built with internal concurrency and are draw-able.  I put that aside to work on documenting/making-accessible diagrams-as-syntax (DaS).  Before that, I built (with Ken K's help) a full SVG-diagrams-to-lisp transpiler.
