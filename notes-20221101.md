What do you think it's for?

I see everything as fractals.  In this case, I see that I'm learning 2 things:
1. "Seeing" targets as shaded.  Take care of the dark parts, the rest will emerge. My biggest revelation.  One of the mistakes I always make is to hard-outline shapes, instead of letting the shading do the work.
2. Learning to use painting materials such as Acrylic Paints, Brushes, Water-Colour Paints, etc.

I -think- that I might explore how to use a computer to do 2 instead of using horse-hair and strands of synthetic fibers, all while revelation (1) is still fresh in my mind.

Another big revelation for me is in (2).  Using a Tortillion (the girl at Curry's called it a "smudge stick") to remove hard edges and to smoothly blend areas together and to remove pencil strokes.
