If this is easy, tell me how, if it's not easy, tell me that it's not easy, but, don't waste time on this.  I'm exploring, looking for a path of least resistance.

I understand that this is a weekend, and do not expect this question to be read until a work day...

Q: I want to use index.html as a "shell script", effectively doing:
```
python3 extractFigure.py | node transpilefigure.js
```

or...

```
#!/bin/bash
tempfile=temp_${RANDOM}
python3 extractFigure.py >${tempfile}
node transpilefigure.js ${tempfile}
rm ${tempfile}
```

I.E. run some Python, capture the result (in any way), then pass the result to a Javascript function.

I'm happy to debug only the JS portion, but, if there's a way to debug, both, Python and JS at the same time, do let me know.

Currently, I'm using Chrome and Safari, but, I can switch to something like repl.it or vscode, if it makes more sense.

thanks
