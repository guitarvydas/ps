# Goal of Programming

## What is The Goal of programming?
The Goal of programming is to control a machine using any means possible, and, to reduce our burden in doing so.

## Corollary: Not The Goal
Fixating on a single notation, based on glyphs invented for clay-tablets, is Not a Goal of programming. 

At best, this is a sub-goal of programming.
