What should I look at...  I think that I want to copy an Obsidian document - and copy all of the documents that it links to - to another place (leaving the originals where they are).

background: I just finished a Jam and did the documentation in Obsidian using backlinks.  I've published the documentation using Obsidian Publish.  I know that I will edit the Obsidian documentation, but I want to keep a frozen version "somewhere".

(default: create a new vault and drag'n'drop the document into that vault, then review the document and manually drag'n'drop each linked document (recursively) into the vault, and manually altering the backlinks) (creating HTML or PDF would be OK, too, but the main problem is following the backlinks)

Maybe I'm just missing something obvious?

thanks
