HyperCard was a toolbox that allowed non-programmers to create computer applications easily.

Kind of like spreadsheets, but, different.

HyperCard was an Apple-only product.

HyperCard preceded the internet.

At the time, Apple was much, much smaller than Microsoft and Microsoft was much, much smaller than IBM.  There was no such thing as "free" and "open-source" software.  All software was sold by corporations and the source code was almost never made available.  Even UNIX was tightly controlled.  Universities bought source licenses for UNIX and made the source code available to students, but, it was otherwise illegal to own UNIX source code without having paid Bell Labs a licensing fee (generally about 3 years worth of a standard salary).

Apple's Mac operating system was tightly controlled and restricted for use only on Apple computers.

Apple computers and products were perceived to be very high-priced.  Few people owned Apple computers.

Most people built their own computers using separately bought motherboards and peripherals.

Microsoft made MSDOS and BIOS available for use on such unbundled hardware.  IBM created and sold its PC containing IBM-proprietary MSDOS extensions.  

PCs could be opened up and peripherals could be added to the motherboards' busses.  At first, IBM resisted this trend and tried to keep its PCs closed.

HyperCard never really caught on because it was out of the reach of most people, existing only on higher-priced Apple computers.  

HyperCard was closed-source.

Apple eventually discontinued HyperCard.
