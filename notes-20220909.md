Most people don't /think/ that they want to create their own applications.   Yet, a select few went for Hypercard and spreadsheets.  Dentist office software began happening only when spreadsheets became available.  Spreadsheets were invented for Accountants, but innovators with domain expertise in Dentist Officery picked up on the new paradigm.

This makes me think of Franz, Inc.'s business model (free, but % royalty on all apps).

> Paul,

> WOW, your story about losing interest in everything you planned for retirement is really fascinating. So sorry to hear that, 

Nothing to be sorry about.  This change in interests did not create a void, it simply replaced my 40yo opinions with new 60yo opinions about what is interesting.  I guess that I'm surprised that my opinions changed ...

> The upside and downside of being self employed 

Yeah, I was a software consultant.  Long periods "between" jobs.  It was hard to tell if I was suffering from just another "long period between jobs" or if I was "retired".  I found that I really didn't want to do what anyone else asked me to do, so I didn't want to "work", so, I guess I became "retired".

I guess that the term "index" is American.  I use the term "handicap" and had to infer what the word "index" meant.  (I'm still not sure if it is subtly different from what I know as "handicap").

My best was 26.  I was, then, reading Mangum's book and I would get annoyed if I didn't 0-putt at least once in a round.  I, also, expected to have less than 32 putts per round.

Then, my brother died.  He was 4 years younger than me.  He owned 2 Ferraris and his office was across the street from the Microsoft campus.

I shot 130 that year, for the first time.

> ... I think trusting the swing and game you have is a great idea. Lately, for me, not thinking about the mechanics during the swing has been incredibly helpful 

Yeah, I over-engineer everything about golf.  Not good.

I can hit my 3R without thinking about it.  I just hit it.

With most of my other clubs, I keep /thinking/ about /trusting/ them.  Including the putter.

My score doesn't seem to improve.

> as I’m playing the best golf of my life. 

I think that I'm playing the best golf of my life, but, my score remains the same - hovering around 100.

I've had epiphanies, like closing my eyes when practicing a putt (Inner Game of Golf, probably).

When I close my eyes, I can feel the clubface - heel, toe, middle, etc.

I've been 3-putting a lot lately.  And riding instead of walking.  I used to walk 4 miles a day, but, now my toes are curled up and walking ain't fun.

A huge epiphany has been to keep the ball low, except when necessary.  I played my best when we played a high-end private course.  I got lots of roll, 'cause the fairways were firm and well-mowed.

Maybe my biggest epiphany is that it is "not how hard you can hit it", but, "how softly you can hit it".  I got some of this from my brother when he tried to teach me his favourite past-time - billiards.

Another part of that epiphany came after visiting David Lee.  He, or his student(s), said something that made me experiment with just dropping the club onto the ball when chipping/pitching.  When I let gravity do the work, instead of trying to control the club, I got the most beautiful pitches I've ever made.  I didn't understand the concept of "just let the club do the work" until I simply dropped the club and hung onto it.

> Also playing from the White Tees doesn’t hurt.  

Long shots, e.g. white tees, kill me.  I try too hard.

I spent some time building a spreadsheet based on 150-yd bunts.  By that measure, the red tees tend to be harder than the white tees, on the courses that I play.  Surprising result.

Par is 3 for me on every hole.  One iron, two putts.  The stuff before that is a series of 150-yd bunts.  I didn't understand the concept of "personal par" until I worked on that spreadsheet.  Every now and then, one of the bunts goes a LOT further than I expect.

By that calculation, I should be shooting in the '80's, but, I'm not.  Hmm, I'm reading Mangum's book again.

Another revelation is the idea of keeping it on the fairway.  I don't use a driver if I'm not dead sure that I will hit the fairway.  My buddies use Drivers off of every tee (except par 3's).  I don't.

Working the ball is a lot easier from the fairway than from the rough.

I'm tired of military golf (left-right-left-right).

If I'm in the rough, I now use a club that will put me into he fairway at worst.  This goes against my instincts.  I used to try to reach the green and spray my shots (more military golf).  Now, I use much shorter irons that put me back onto the fairway and, secondarily only, advance the ball.  E.g. if I'm in the rough 200 yds from the green and 50 yds from the other side, I force myself to use an iron which goes less than 50 yds and will put me on the fairway regardless of how badly I hit it.  (Actually, I have more accuracy with my shorter irons, so I may go for 70-120 yds).

And, I use a lot more club than what I think I need.  I measured the distance for my clubs.  Yet, if I use way more club, I'm more likely to hit it more gently and let my instincts figure out how hard, instead of trying a full-out shot.  Something like 2 clubs more.  Esp. from rough. E.g. 6 instead of 8.  Again, the addage "use more club" never made sense to me until I tried it.

Tidbit: to hit low, add 2 clubs and use only 1/2 swing.  For me, 130yds is a 7.  To hit 130yds under a tree, I use 5 and a half-swing.  This one, I don't practice and don't think about, I just hit it.  Works pretty good.  Ball way back in the stance.

Tidbit: scores are better in the morning than in the afternoon (!).  Holes are fresh-cut in the morning and have no lumpy donut, yet.

Tidbit: the center of the swing is the top of your head, not the center of your chest.  (I wish I believed that 20 years ago - back to the drawing board :-).

I have to lay off from November to March.  I'm itching to play by April.  I start reading something new in February.  I start all over every year.  This might explain my lack of improvement.  I get 7 months to perfect a new technique before having to lay off again and re-start next April with new swing thoughts.

Billiards taught me that clubface is king.  And, that gentle-ness is king.

Engineering taught me to remember 1,000 details.

Mangum's book began to teach me that Self1 doesn't need to micro-manage the 1,000 details, and, that Science says so.  It's OK to be an Engineer (and have studied Physics), yet, let Self2 take care of the details.  Software and the recent advances in A.I. say the same thing.  Geoffrey Hinton is back in Toronto and I got to attend some A.I. seminars sponsored by him, which strengthened my belief in the not-yet-engineerable.

I expect to shoot 72 next time...
