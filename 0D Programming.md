0-dependency programming

N0D - non-zero dependency programming
- e.g. Python, Rust, C++, Bash, etc, etc

Is programming in a N0D language a desirable skill to learn?

Predicated on the idea that "programming" can only be done with N0D languages (like Python, Rust, C++, JS, name-your-favourite language, etc.), and, therefore learning to "program" using N0D languages, like Python, is a desirable skill.  

It takes years of University education to beat common-sense out of a student, to learn N0D programming.

In real-life, everything humans do, is 0D, except programming.  That is the main reason why programming is "hard" (IMO).
