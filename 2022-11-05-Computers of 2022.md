The word "computer" is re-purposed to mean a conglomeration of 1,000 rPis (Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, cores, etc.) to address the needs of robotics, IoT, internet, blockchain, etc., etc.

The rPis are arranged in a strict, loosely-coupled hierarchical manner communicating via Structured Message Passing (layered message passing, Up, Down, Across, Through, using queues instead of stacks).  [Aside: The rPis are NOT arranged in a tightly-coupled graph].

Each rPi runs single-threaded software written in something like Haskell, Python, C, etc.  (My latest POC along these lines is called Py0D https://github.com/guitarvydas/py0d).

Each rPi merrily does its own thing at its own speed and passes commands/results down and up a tree in a big business Org-Chart -like manner.

A not-yet-existing programming language ties all of this activity together (I look at /bin/sh, FBP, StateCharts, whiteboarding, etc. for inspiration).
