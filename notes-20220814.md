If we're going to reinvent the wheel, then I suggest that the concept of "operating system" should be reinvented.

My notes about Operating Systems, in screencast form: https://beta-share.descript.com/view/gdfwt4MfKjF
1. divide-and-conquer - developers vs. end-users
2. divide-and-conquer - 2 main technical aspects of operating systems
3. bloatware
4. processes

(disclaimer: I'm toying with Descript beta to produce tech video.  This is my first attempt and might be unduly klunky)
(disclaimer: I'm still mulling on what to do for the jam.  There is a strong chance that I won't be able to decide before the jam ends.)  
(ps. I would be happy to discuss this stuff with anyone who is interested...)
