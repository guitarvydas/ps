dynamic languages are like bicycles for the mind, static languages are like convoys of trucks, there are places you just can't take them.

Dynamic languages are like bicycles for the mind, static languages are like tugboats.

If it weren't for dynamic languages, Racket might not have macros at all.

There is a huge difference between thinking something up and optimizing it after-the-fact.

Static languages are for optimizing-after-the-fact and inhibit the act of bicycling.  The apparent difference is subtle.

To make a language compilable, you have to change the language and remove all features that are bicycles for the mind.

If it weren't for dynamic languages, Racket might not have macros at all.

There is a huge difference between thinking something up and optimizing it after-the-fact.

To make a language compilable, you have to /change/ the language and remove all features that are bicycles for the mind.

"Don't use compilers".  Deeper meaning: at first, don't use languages that were /altered/ for compilability.  Begin with dynamic languages, then graduate to optimizing-after-the-fact with compilable languages.  

Wish: a dynamic language *lint*er that suggests changes to make the (dynamic) code more compilable.  Gradual compilability.  Trackable.  Provenance.

Thursday, Erik:

PEG is like REGEX, only better.  Ohm-JS is better than PEG.

With Ohm-JS you can sprinkle pattern-matching into your apps like candy.  With Language-Theoretic Parsers, you can't.  You Just Don't Bother(tm) to think that way, because pattern-matching becomes a mega-project.

Pattern-matching is a paradigm, like GC, say.  Compilers need to use that paradigm and call it "parsing".  You can, also, use the pattern-matching paradigm in non-compiler apps.

Here's a 5-line grammar the slurps C code.  I am allowed to think that way with Ohm-JS, but not with LR(k). https://github.com/guitarvydas/cparse/blob/main/cparse.ohm

[I, also, built a Scheme->JS converter to transpile Nils Holm's prolog.scm to prolog.js.  This was one of the first things I built in Ohm-JS, so not exactly rocket science ...]

- e.g. like GC, say.  
- Compilers need to use the pattern-matching paradigm.  Pattern-matching is called "parsing", when used by a compiler.  
- You can, also, use the pattern-matching paradigm in non-compiler apps.

FBP

a) what is a way to write Factorial in FBP?
b) I am looking for an example of how message-passing is not the same as recursion
c) am I correct in thinking that streaming via bounded buffers is message-passing and not recursion?
