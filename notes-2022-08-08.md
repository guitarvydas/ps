[[2022-08-09-Expressivity Lost]]

---
A lot of expressitivity was lost in the mad rush to premature optimization (AKA compilation and over-use of synchronization and over-thinking of "efficiency").  Liveness was easier, multitasking was easier, hot-loading was easier, debuggers were easier, etc., etc.
...
IMO "static languages" aren't worth all the trouble they've caused.
...
Agenda: Expunge the callstack from all new languages.

----

further throught: an array of 12x12 CPUs is 2D, whereas Harel Statecharts and 7x7+(recursive)dive is 3D.  Structured Message Passing for asynch is like Structured Programming was for assembler programming.  Assembler programming with a callstack is meant for a single CPU, whereas async with message passing is for multiple, distributed CPUs.
