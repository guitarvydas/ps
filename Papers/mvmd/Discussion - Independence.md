## Independence
In programming lingo, *independence* maps to *concurrency* and *nesting* maps to *sequential* operation.  

*Concurrency* is the first step in making something *parallel*.  

*Sequential operation* is the basis of most programming languages.

I argue that *sequential operation* is the reason why programming is considered to be difficult.
