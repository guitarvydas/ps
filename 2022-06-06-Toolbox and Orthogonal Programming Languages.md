I present a *toolbox language* that is an intermediate text form for programming, based on syntax stacks, which allows programming to be *divided and conquered* at the syntactic level.  

I, also, introduce the notion of Orthogonal Programming Languages, which is meant to allow designing programming languages using *divide and conquer* by dividing PLs into two phases 
	- operations
	- operands.
