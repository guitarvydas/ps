off-topic question: editing trick sought: I want to rolling record a screencast and do multiple takes without stopping the recording.  I want to place markers while recording (each time I re-start?) to make later editing easier.  Is there a name for this kind of live-marking?  I am having trouble googling for it, which usually means that I'm using the wrong search-phrase.  My basic problem is that I freeze when I hit the record button and I need a few restarts to sound natural again ; I don't want to audition the whole recording and edit out the false starts later.  Are there any better tricks for recording this way?  Descript can do this, but expects to AI-transpile the whole session, which is over-kill (since it AI-transcribes the out-takes, too, which I know will be cut out).
