todo:
We will discuss the question of what makes a good drawing for representing programs.  What ideas can be used to construct DaS syntaxes? [[What Makes a Good DaS Syntax?]]

We will discuss Ohm-JS, why it is a better PEG and why PEG is better for parsing than previous technologies. [[Why PEG Why Ohm]]

We will discuss the use of current programming languages as *assembler* for the next generation of progamming languages, esp. DaS. [[The Next Generation of Programming Languages]]
