Hi Stan

I want to pick your brain about golf, when you have time.

My problem is that I keep improving my swing, but my score doesn't improve.

At the moment, I think that I need to improve my short game.

I think that a short-game par is 3 - one short iron to the green plus 2 putts.

I don't achieve a short-game par very often.  I usually score 4 or higher, lots of 3-putts, lots of extra short iron shots.

Maybe I'm looking at things the wrong way, maybe I just need to practice more.

I've be happy to shoot in the 80's, but I struggle to break 100.

Do you have suggestions?

I'm new to Descript and even newer to Storyboard.  Basic question:
I want to create a technical presentation (and edit it).
I created a set of slides (in Obsidian).
I want to add verbal commentary to each slide.

I want the video from the slides and the audio from the commentary.
I want to delete the audio from the slides and replace it with commentary snippets.

The slide scenes are about 1 second long.  The audio scene is about 20 sec. long.  I want to 

What I tried: 
- working on Macbook 2018.
- Create slides.  
- Clicked New Storyboard Project.
- Video record slides along with saying a count (one, two, three ...)
- Added slashes before each number in the script to create a new scene for each slide.
- Tried "record audio only" - the blue button does nothing (no recording).
- Tried "record screen (with USB audio -> usb mic)".  Clicked blue button then space bar to start recording.  Talked.  Clicked red square to stop recording.
- Problem: I don't know how to split the new audio from the new video.  I don't see how to delete the old audio ("one"). I don't know how to move the new audio to coincide with the old video (slide 1).  I don't know how to lengthen the old video (slide 1) to run for the full extent of the new audio.
- background: I'm a software dev.  I've used Logic and Ableton for audio recording.  (I've touched video recording with iMovie and Da Vinci Resolve).

I am trying to create a very technical slideshow.  I want to separate the video from one scene and stretch it over the next scene, keeping the audio in the next scene, but overriding the video with the video from the previous scene.  How?  I am new to Descript and even newer to Storyboard.
