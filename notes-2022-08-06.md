[+]  Word, Obsidian live-editor, Typora, etc. For example, italics can be toggled on and off live and the effect is seen immediately. 

Maybe live-editing is like AI.  Once you achieve it, it is no longer called by that name.

Most real people create things that are not collections of mathematical functions, hence, live-editing of mathematical functions doesn't get a lot of attention.  Most so-called "Programming Languages" are based on mid-1900s biases (mathematical functions based on text meant for clay-tablets and paper).  Most real apps don't bother to expose so-called "Programming Languages" to humans.

As far as I know, there are no "programming languages" that are targetted at 95% of real coding - the creation of history-based sequencers (movies, DAWs, internet servers, etc.).  These kinds of live programming systems are built using unsuitable programming languages and elbow-grease.

I've been ignoring mathematical equations, since I think that equations constitute the ultimate toy example.

CompSci is very closed-minded about what constitutes programming.  It's like saying that Physics explains all of Cosmology, except the 95% of Cosmology called "dark matter".  Writing textual programs as functions is about creating calculators, but, programming is much more than just building calculators.

- Microsoft Word is live-editing (of desktop publishing aretefacts)
- Apple Dictation is live-editing (you see text created live as you speak)
- "scrubbing" in movie editors and DAWs is live-editing (-> YouTube, etc.)
- iterative drum-loop creation is live-editing
- sonicPI, Ableton, etc. is live-editing (live performance)
- collaboration tools are live-editing (even though the created artefact is often dead ASCII Art, e.g. vscode allows multiple people to live-create a restricted form of Art (called "textual programs"), likewise, Kinopio allows multiple people to live-create mind-maps)
- colorization is live-editing

Maybe "live editing" is like AI?  Once you do it, it ain't called "live editing" any more.

Coding is programming.  Programming is controlling a computer to produce a desired result (usually by use of boring, repetitive processes).  NB programming is "controlling a computer using any means necessary".  Coding is the act of creating such programs.  To create textual, sequential programs, we use so-called "programming languages".  To create other kinds of computer programs, we use other representations, not just text.  Live-coding is simply the act of creating programs - in any representation - and seeing the final result(s) ASAP.  Live-coding is all around us, but most of the live-coding tools are not targetted at producing mathematical equations and function calls.

- Live-coding producing publications: Microsoft Word
- Live-coding producing text documents: Apple Dictation
- Live-coding producing videos: "scrubbing" ; iMovie, Davinci Resolve, etc.
- Live-coding producing music: DAWs, "scrubbing", live-editing of "automation".
- Live-coding producing musical Art (performance): Ableton Live, sonicPI, etc.
- Live-coding producing drum loops: iterative looping and layered recording in drum loop editors
- Live-coding producing Ascii Art: vscode, etc., colorization
- Live-coding producing mind-maps: Kinopio, etc.
- Live-coding producing accounting artefacts: spreadsheets
- Live-coding producing production-line robots: robotic arm training
- Live-coding producing programs: Lisp, REPLs, etc.
- Live-coding producing "visualization" of CPU operation: single-stepping debuggers (the live-coding language is the debugger REPL language, not the target language)

- live-coding producing 2D Art - tablet pencils and software
