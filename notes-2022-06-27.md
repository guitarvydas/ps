I wish that Kinopio gave me the ability to write snippets of JavaScript to generate/affect cards, like [emacs org-mode](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/)

(I'm developer (retired) and wish that I could use Kinopio as a programming IDE)

Kinopio as a programming IDE

- slap components onto page in any order
- organize after-the-fact
- create groups and "demote" them to new pages, leaving only a single component on the current page
- Leaf components contain code with async inputs and async outputs
- Container components compose components (Leaf or Container) into larger system layers
- use alpha channel to dim certain components
- push a button to generate executable code from a selected system layer

riffing on previous idea
"my stuff"
a friend just passed away, his wife is going through his contact lists to see who to notify
-> product idea - software safety deposit box
- contains list of contacts
- contains list of passwords
- held at "bank" needing 2 keys (1 bank, 1 owner) 
- contains will
- contains power-of-attorney documents
- instead of a "bank", maybe the safety deposit box should be held at the funeral home, or, with a lawyer (esp. for power of attorney)
- factoid: I know an expert in blockchain who is working on one-off ownership of virtual items (NFTs on steroids?)

-> product idea
- virtual estate 
- "worlds", "meta-spaces" specialized
- "worlds" can be granted in wills

-> product idea
- NFT World for creation of new software concepts
- includes code
- includes youtubes
- includes Obsidian notes/essays

aside: analogy: NFTs are like virtual "patents".  Disclose technique, but profit from idea (patents: for XX years, NFTs: in one up-front lump sum + royalties)

Save the attachment to Downloads.

Open it there (double-click in Finder on a Mac, I don't remember how to do this on Windows (probably right-click>>open)). 

If it looks like info, then it's OK.  (Just text or pdf).

If it contains more clickable URLs, don't click.

The big danger is asking Mail or Safari to deliver you to a dodgy website.  Clicking on blue-underilned clickable links can do that sometimes (but not always).  Saving to Downloads sucks the information to your hard drive but doesn't send you to the website.

One of my browsers - probably Chrome - shows me the destination of a link in the status bar.  I haven't figured out how to see this same detail in Safari.

Don't click.  Use control-click (right-click) and you will remain in control.
