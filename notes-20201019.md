Rambling question that should need no thought/time-spent-answering...  I'm sorry, but I don't even know how to phrase this as a question:

What is the js/node.js best practice?

How do I use an app/library written in JS from another JS app, and, later, from Python/Racket/whatever?

boring details:

I have a lump of JS that I want to use and re-use in some way.

I want to use the app in another JS app, or, later, use the app in another Python (or Racket/whatever) app.

I keep getting bitten by the subtle differences between HTML JavaScript and node.js.  Maybe I need to learn more about how to use imports and exports correctly?  (If so, is there a good place to start?)

I immediately gravitate to making the JS reusable app a "binary" command-line app (the UNIX philosophy).

ATM I'm using node.js-specific "requires()" and "exports" code that is not acceptable to HTML JS (non node.js JS)

If I make the node.js program a shebang app, then the requires() lines in the code are resolved only later and result in errors.  That's because shebang apps are not binary apps, but are interpreted.

ATM I think there is only 1 option: delete the requires() and paste in copies of the required code.  The reusable app becomes a big ball of code that needs to include nothing else.

In "other languages" I would use "imports" and "#includes" to build a binary, not a shebang app.


It *seems* that the generic answer is: stop using JS and switch to Rust or Python or whatever.

My reusable app is a wrapper over ohm-js.  All written in JS  This part MUST be written in JS, since I don't want to rewrite all of ohm-js in Python or something else.  Somewhere, somehow, I need to invoke a program written in JS.


I see that Ohm-JS is minified - I know nothing about this.  I assume that the process of minification deals with this problem, but I don't know how.

In a quick skim of Enso, I see the word "polyglot".  Maybe what I want is not easy and becomes a "feature"?

FWIW, I've come to the conclusion that the secret sauce of concurrency is 0D (my word for low-level decoupling).  FIFOs instead of LIFOs (queues instead of stacks, or, queues in addition to stacks).  Example code, in Python, is at https://github.com/guitarvydas/py0d.  I'm +experimenting+ with ways to describe these observations (Descript, leanpub, Obsidian, github pages, Discord channel, etc.). Undecided. Some background material (free) is also at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD8QpV-t5eM and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44OSafUjos0.  The trick is (1) achieve 0D as described in the above material, (2) create 2 classes of Components: Containers and Leaves, (3) Structured Message Passing (Down, Across, Up, Pass-Through).  Code is not the issue (if I can learn Python and implement this in it, then it can be done by anyone, especially if closures or pointers-to-functions can be used).  Discipline is the issue, i.e. learning not to over-use synchronization.  Aside: my fetish for diagram compilers actually boils down to 0D.
