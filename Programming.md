Programming has one goal:
- control a machine.

Programming is facilitated by a *divide-and-conquer* approach.  We dissect programming into, roughly, two camps:
1. describe data
2. describe control flow

Data description is facilitated by the tried-and-true concepts of mathematical functions.

Control flow description is facilitated by:
- pattern matching
- parsing
- Statecharts
- Drakon diagrams
- ?
