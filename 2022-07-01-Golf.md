# 2 kinds of swing:
1. full swing
2. partial swing

## Partial Swing
Also known as:
- short game (incl. putting)
- scoring clubs

# Tee Shot
Use full swing until you get into partial swing range.

# Scoring Range
About 100 yards and in.

Do not swing fully, stay in control, make ball go where you want it to end up.  Finesse.  It's not how hard you hit it, it is how gently you hit it.

Use much more club than for full swing (e.g. +3 clubs)

Count scoring shots, not just putts
- golfpad segrates shots into 2 categories
	1. shot
	2. putt
I use "putt" to track *all* scoring range shots.  Ideal is 3 (one pitch, 2 putts).

Roll the ball.

Loft the ball only if necessary, e.g. over trap and rough, where ball cannot roll.

In wet conditions, ball doesn't roll, consider lofting ball.

Loft ball if short-sided on green, the higher the ball goes, the less it will roll when it hits the green.

Work the ball.

# Grip
Centrifugal force pulls the club away from you as you swing in an arc.  

Analogy: a ball on a string swung in a circle. Centrifugal force is what keeps the string taught.

As club is pulled away from you, your arms straighten to their natural palm-to-palm orientation (different for every person).  If you set up with a strong grip, then the clubface will open and you will hit a slice.  If you set up with a weak grip, the clubface will close and you will hit a hook.

# Working The Ball (Draw, Fade)
You can work the ball only with partial swing (hit it too hard and it will go straight at best).

You can work the ball only from the fairway.  Grass in rough interferes with club/ball contact and makes contact unpredictable.

To *fade* the ball stand slightly open, swing along body line (not ball/target line).  Contact so that clubface brushes across the ball giving it sidespin (clockwise spin for right-handers).

To *draw* the ball, the clubface must brush across the ball giving it sidespin (counter-clockwise for right-handers).

Working the ball needs much more club.
- For example, my 6iron goes 140yd on a full swing, but only 110yd on a big fade (3 clubs difference).

# Personal Par
Full shots can go wild.

If you can't reach scoring range with one full shot, use more shots.

For example, on a par 4, a "personal par" of 4+1 means that you get 2 shots to get into scoring range, then one pitch and 2 putts (2+1+2 = 5).

The "Par" concept is evil.  It measures only what the best players can do.  If you are not a PGA player, then the given *Par* is a meaningless concept.  Adjust your expectations so that you get 1 pitch and 2 putts to finish a hole.

# Fairway
It is easier to hit a controlled shot from the fairway, than from the rough or from a fairway bunker.

Try to get onto the fairway for scoring shots.

If your drives go off-line, that's more OK than if your scoring shots go off-line.

# Distance
Driving distance is meaningless.

If you are on a 400yd "par 4", then you only need 2 150yd shots to get into scoring range (1 pitch, 2 putts).

400 = 150 + 150 + 100

# Chipping
Chipping is a putting-like stroke made from off of the green.  

Usually, chips are made from rough.

Use just enough loft to get over the rough and get rolling on the green.

## Landing Spot
Don't look at the hole when chipping.  

Read the green, pick a spot to land, from which the ball can roll towards the hole.

The chosen spot should be very small, e.g. the size of a dime.  I look for a blemish on the green and try to hit it.

Look at the chosen landing spot, not the hole.

# Putting
## Uphill
Putt past the hole 6-feet for every inch of uphill elevation.

## Downhill
Don't putt to the hole.  

Pick a "virtual hole" some feet before the hole.  Putt to the virtual spot.
## Reading the Green
There is exactly one higest-spot and exactly one lowest-spot on a hole.

Your instincts know how to find the high/low spots.

Let's call the high-spot "12 o'clock" and the low spot "6 o'clock".  Your instincts can tell you how to find 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock.  Then, split the 3/9 read in half and you know where 12/6 is.

## The Last 3 Feet
The read that matters the most is the read for where the ball slows down (the ball is breaks more as it slows).

That's the last 3 feet before the hole.

Everything before 3 feet is "inconsequential", because the ball is moving quickly and powers through the breaks.

## Speed vs. Read (Touch)
[Geoff Mangum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-anHCPCCIk)

## Trick #1 For Finding 3/9
My favourite trick is:
- imagine doing a push-up at the hole
	- imagine dropping down and doing a push-up at the hole.
	- your hands will instinctively land on 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock
	- (since your body knows how to balance itself)

## Trick #2 For Finding 6/12
Walk around the hole, keeping the same distance away from the hole.

Ideally, walk about 3 feet from the hole (the breaking zone).

You feet/ankles will tell you when you've reached the highest point.  The lowest point is directly across from the highest point.
