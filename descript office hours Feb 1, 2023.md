Hints Needed: I am building quickie technical screencasts and am looking for ways to speed up my workflow.

Background: I "write" the story by winging a screencast - screen + speaking - and recording it to Descript.

...


I need to tighten-up the speaking/audio portion.  There are places where I drag words out as I think, and, the first take is very "stilted" sounding, but, the video of the screen is what I want.  It is easy for me to copy/paste the transciption into an editor and to pare it down to something that I can read out loud.  On the second take, I read the edited script with more inflection.  I want to replace the original audio with the new audio, and, I might need to edit the new audio to line up with action on the screen.

I'm doing this one sentence at a time and it's taking forever.  About one day for two minutes of finished product.  I am wondering if I can improve this workflow but I don't have enough experience to know what to do.

My goal is to have a zero learning curve for doing this, or, at least to come down the learning curve as fast as possible without knowing everything there is to know about Descript while making acceptable-quality technical youtubes.  

Ideally, I should be able to knock these videos off with my iPhone, but, I don't understand what I mean by this.

use screenrecorder from within project (not widget)

I often used Tech words like "JSON" and "Ohm-JS".  They usually are mis-transcribed, e.g. as "Jason"

I finished reading your book draft (long ago).

I agree with all of what is said, yet, there is this lingering feeling that there are a few "little things" that would help me change my bad habits and begin learning afresh.

I've been programmed by watching too much Golf Channel.  I need to be deprogrammed.

Currently, I think I have two major faults:
1. I deep-down-believe that I need to HIT the ball with a lot of force.
2. I deep-down-believe that all of my power comes from arm motion.

I've been following the above beliefs for some 20+ years and haven't been getting much better.  I studied Physics at one point in university and I know what an inclined plane is, but my brain refuses to listen to my logic, and resorts to windmill action, like what I think I see on T.V. (Windmill is non-inclined plane).

Bizarrely, it was a revelation to me (a year or so ago), that one wants to contact the ball with the face of the club.  The Golf Channel made me deep-down-believe that I needed to create perfect divots and that clubface-ball contact was secondary.

insights:

Bizarrely, my brother's addiction to billiards has helped me some.  I learned that you gently nudge/tap the cue ball, you don't whack it.

I have an indoor putting mat that I have been using during winter, and, found that I would sink more putts if I closed my eyes during the swing. [This drove me nuts, since I'm a Science kind of guy.  It makes no sense if the machine can't see what it's doing.]

With closed-eyes putting, I quickly learned that I NEVER intend to scoop the ball.  I try to stop the clubhead AT the ball and momentum just keeps the clubhead moving past the ball, after my arms have stopped moving.

I fixed this by twirling (around my spine? around my left leg?) and keeping the clubhead in sync with the rest of my body.  With my eyes closed, I could "feel" when the clubhead was zipping ahead of the rest of me.  I have now graduated to keeping my eyes open and "feeling" the same stuff.

Listening to Manuel de la Torre lecture a bunch of PGA teachers on YouTube helped me a lot.  He insists on focussing on the clubhead instead of body parts.  My swing changed drastically after thinking about the clubhead.  Just about every (weekly) round this past year, someone in the (ever-changing) foursome would comment that I had a "smooth" swing, effortless.

... computer-related technicalities ...
I am searching for technologies to help me "write" books about software programming.  Currently, I am enamoured with Descript.com which seems to make it much easier to crank out videos (e.g. YouTube).

I hope that I'm missing something real obvious...  Everyone seems to think that what I want is simple, but I haven't figured out how to do what I want simply.  I don't know enough to formulate a coherent question.  background: I create screencasts in two passes - in pass (1) I make up a "story" and record the screen while I think and talk out loud.  In pass (2), I edit the recording and the transcript, then re-read the script with more interest (and fewer halts) in my voice.  I want to paste the re-recording over top of the audio from pass (1), while keeping the (edited) bits of video from pass (1).  It seems that I can use the audio-only recorder to record pass (2) and then paste it into the Descript video+audio recording from pass (1).  I have to detach the pass (1) audio and reduce its gain to nothing.  If I delete words, eventually Descript just deletes all of the video, leaving me with a black screen instead of the video that I want to keep.  This doesn't work at all if I try to write the script and use overdub. I guess that I expect to be able to delete the audio from pass 1 and to paste "B-roll" audio over top of it (B-roll audio, not B-roll video).  This sounds like it should be a no-brainer, but everything I do affects the video that I want to keep.  I guess that I want someone to hand-hold me and tell me exactly (details of keyboard/menu operations) how to paste new audio over top of a video recording.  I can do what I want by pasting still screenshots into the scenes, but I want to keep the non-still video of the screen (mouse movement, highlighting, etc.)
