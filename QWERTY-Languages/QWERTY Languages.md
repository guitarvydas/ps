- N0D
	- non-zero-dependency
	- the goal should be 0D - zero-dependency - languages
- predicated on biases of mid-1900s hardware
		- expensive CPUs 
			- need to timeshare
			- language must run on 1 CPU
				- Loops
		- expensive memory
			- GC
- pervasive synchrony
	- epicycles needed to build async on top of pervasive sync
		- epicycles lead to unpleasant surprises
			- e.g. Mars Pathfinder disaster
			- e.g. preemption 
- predicated on mathematics
	- based on 1,000s year-old biases
		- clay tablets
		- pencil and paper
		- markings ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom, etc.
		- loose molecules (graphite)
		- various liquid chemicals (inks, pigments)
- strict grids of non-overlapping small bitmaps
- underlying assumption of all developer-oriented programming languages
- not related to current hardware capabilities 
	- underkill
	- e.g. bitmapped screens
	- e.g. overlapping windows
	- e.g. pointing devices in addition to qwerty keyboards
	- e.g. media - sound and video
