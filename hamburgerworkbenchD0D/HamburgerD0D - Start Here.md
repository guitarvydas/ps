Goal:
- create hamburger workbench from diagrams
- transpile the diagrams to JS
- future: *transpile the diagrams to CL, Racket, Python, C++, etc.*

## Diagram Programs
Note: this, DaS (Diagrams as Syntax) is not the same as what is called VPL (Visual Programming Languages).  The diagrams below are a hybrid of text plus very simple visual elements (rectangles, ellipses, lines, text).

Note: the diagrams below were created using draw.io, but, any convenient-to-use SVG editor would do.
