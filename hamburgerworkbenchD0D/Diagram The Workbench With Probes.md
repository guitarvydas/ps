Here, I've added "probe" components to observe messages as they travel along the connections.

Ideally a single drawing can contain multiple instances of the same component.

In this example, though, for simplicity, I've created unique "probe" components and do not rely on multiple instantiation.

[In fact, the code for this POC does not support multiple instances of the same Component.  I expect to re-implement the system using DaS and will address the multiple instance issue then,.]
