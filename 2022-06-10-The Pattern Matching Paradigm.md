With Ohm-JS you can sprinkle pattern-matching into your apps like candy.  With Language-Theoretic Parsers, you can't.  You Just Don't Bother(tm) to think that way, because pattern-matching becomes a mega-project.

[aside: I, also, built a Scheme->JS converter to transpile Nils Holm's prolog.scm to prolog.js.  This was one of the first things I built in Ohm-JS, so not exactly rocket science.  If I can do it, anyone can do it...]
