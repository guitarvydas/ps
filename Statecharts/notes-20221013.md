newbie question?

I published a 40% finished book.

The landing page does not show the table of contents for the book.

I created a preview for the book and reviewed it with MacOS/Preview (PDF viewer).

Maybe my expectations are wrong or maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I don't know, yet, where to look/what to do, I'm still coming down the learning curve.

thanks
