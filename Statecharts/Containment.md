# Containment

One of the major contributions of the StateChart paper is the diagram syntax for *containment*.

## Diagrams vs. ASCII Art

Many of our advances in computer science have been due to *containment*, for example, FP, OO, structured programming, local variables.

Due to the limitations of mid-1900s computer hardware, we developed textual languages that use ASCII Art to express *containment*.  

We use `{ ... }` to signify containers.  

We use function parameters to signify containers (bound variables).

Containment makes immediate sense in diagram form.

We struggle with containment expressed in text.  Currently, one needs a university degree to understand the textual syntax of containment.

Non-programmers don't have problems with containment - it comes naturally.

CEOs draw sketches on whiteboards, expecting the drawings to express containment and isolation (concurrency).  "Everyone" understands what the sketches mean.  CEOs expect Architects and Engineers to "fill in the blanks" and to provide details to implement their visions.
