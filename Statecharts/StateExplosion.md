# State Explosion Problem

Fig. 20 of Harel's paper shows a small-scale example of the state explosion problem.

When you flatten state machines to include all possible transitions between states, you end up needing to clone states.

The problem of state explosion is the antithesis of *containment*.  When you flatten a contained system, you get more states.

Harel's StateChart notation shows how to re-contain state.

Harel's notation shows how to structure the use of state for sequencing.  

State has many uses.  Each kind of use can be isolated and contained.
