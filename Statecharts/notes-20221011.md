Re. topics:
Question: is "Essence of OOP" related to what is called "prototypal inheritance"?  Like Self, Javascript?  Prototypes instead of classes.  If so, then this is the choice.
Other choice: "First-Class Implementations ... Reflection ..."

Re. topics:  Very hard to decide.  "Essence of OOP" is the choice, esp. if this relates to prototype-based inheritance.  Other choice "First-Class Implementations ... Reflection ...".  Thanks, pt.
