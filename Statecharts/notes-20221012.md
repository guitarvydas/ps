I asked a question on the forum about setting the author bio. 

It turns out that I was copy/pasting my bio from an editor (Obsidian) and hitting SAVE.  Then, I hit "Publish New Version" and the bio was cleared (became empty and gave me a warning that my bio was missing. 

It finally worked when I hit ENTER after pasting the bio, then hit SAVE.

> In terms of an author bio, you set that in the About You section ofÂ `https://leanpub.com/user_dashboard/settings`
