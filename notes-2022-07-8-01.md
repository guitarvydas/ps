FYI - update: It seems that a recording created by QuickTime fails to load (error: multiple channels), yet, if the recording is dragged into iMovie and saved out, it works fine.

Generating Javascript for Ohm-JS semantics... 
clone github https://github.com/guitarvydas/fmt-js
1. load fmt-js.html into browser and watch it generate JavaScript
2. load ghoststars/tester.html and watch it generate JSON for a snippet of the Ghoststars game script

I agree that throws are generated and appropriate.

Your examples helped me clarify the problem.  It turns out that my code was converting one of the throws to an undefined result.

I”ve used a lot of linear sequence editors.  Especially for song recording (Logic Pro and Ableton).

I learned to use Davinci Resolve and OBS and iMovie for videos.

I freeze up when I hit the Record button.

The best trick I’ve found for that problem is to loop and do multiple takes with the recorder rolling.  I thaw out after 3-5 takes.  For me, a “take” is approximately one slide in a slide show - i.e. 10’s of seconds instead of the whole talk from beginning to finish.  I.e. I loop over a 10-second portion and re-do it until I’m happy.

Later, to edit, I have to find and delete all of the out-takes.  A painful process when done linearly.  A friend, who is in the video production business, says to leave a silent spot before/after each take, then look for the flat-lines in the audio waveform during editing. 

Then, there’s the “ums”.  I say that a LOT.  When we did the first FBP meetup at Bento Miso, we hired a professional editor.  He marked every “um” then snipped them out.  I noticed that the result was much better.

I don’t feel like paying $’s to a pro editor, and, I don’t really want to edit the video myself (much too boring :-).

Descript is another take on this whole process.  Descript uses AI to convert the audio to written text and links the transcribed text to the audio/video track.  You get to use their word processor to edit the words.  The text-based edits affect the video/audio tracks, e.g. if you cut out a word, the corresponding video/audio gets cut, too.  The cut-out portion causes a jump-cut which can, later, be smoothed out using cross-fades.  In many cases, the jump cuts aren’t very jarring and don’t need to be smoothed.

My biggest problem with Descript is the price.  I’m not sure if I’ll stick with Descript for that reason.

I thought that the 3-hour time limit on the free version was much too short, but, thus far, I haven’t used up half of that.

I find that the Descript workflow is easy - use Descript’s recorder, do a light edit, publish.

I’m still playing with using Descript for any easy workflow.  “Studio Sound” is wonderful, but makes my audio sound a bit robotic.

[I found a default setting of equalizer+a-bit-of-reverb in Logic to make my voice sound thick.  Studio Sound does that with only one button-press].

Every tool (editing software) has its own quirks, and, you will need to go down a learning curve whichever one you choose.  Whatever you pick, you will have to invest time in and the knowledge is not easily transferable to other tools.

You will need a good mic.

My MacBook+iMovie is a close second.  The builtin mic is good (I bought a usb studio mic due to previous prejudices), but, iMovie eats disk space.  Twice now, iMovie has used up all of available space on my main drive and MacOS didn’t deal with it well.  When I use iMovie, I kill it as soon as possible.  I think that it has memory leaks or it takes over a lot of disk space and confuses MacOS.

My workflow is, now:
1. create a single diagram for what I want to discuss
2. record a set of takes with Descript (or with Quicktime+iMovie)
3. do some light editing in Descript
4. copy/paste the transcription into Obsidian
5. edit the Obsidian script and turn it into a set of slides
6. read the slides and record (again) in Descript
7. edit in Descript
8. publish

I think that I start going down too many rabbit holes when I write with a keyboard only.  Speaking and recording makes the result sound a bit more conversational and seems to prevent me from visiting every nook and cranny.  The result is a bit "too conversational", so a bit of text-editing in Obsidian helps to clean it up.  Reading my slides during a recording stops me from making too many gaffs and requires less editing (although some editing is still required, maybe I'll get better with time).

I wonder if the first set of recordings could be done with MacOS Dictation (speech-to-text), but I haven't really tried that workflow.

I see several people using Loom successfully, but, I can't speak off-the-cuff without being too self-conscious about the Record button.  YMMV.

In the morning, I will send you pointers to my recordings in Descript thus far.  If I forget, prod me.

If Descript were free or if it had unlimited record-time, I would use it in a heartbeat.  As it stands, the price makes me want to find something as good, but cheaper.

[I used to write this kind of expense off in my corporation, but, now am retired and can't do exactly that (makes me wonder if I can still expense it somehow?)]

I wonder why Apple hasn't bought-out Descript.  It seems like a natural evolution of Apple's business goals and market direction.

I tried to jump into Descript and got bogged down.  After watching the tutorial videos (Help menu), my workflow changed radically.

I want to find something that makes it easy to get ideas across and to avoid presentation / editing pain.  Blogging in github Pages and Obsidian is almost there, but, I have a lot of unpublished / unfinished essays lying around -> something is wrong with that workflow, for me.

What I really want to do is to read my Takeaways book into YouTube (and my Pattern Matching book) and to discuss the content in a more-conversational way.  I'm not there yet.

... more in the morning ...
