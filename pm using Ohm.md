IMO, the best way to start with Ohm-JS is by using the Ohm Editor.

### My Ohm Workflow
IMO, the best way to develop a language is:
1. create the grammar with the Ohm-Editor
2. Test the grammar using the Ohm-Editor and various language snippets.
3. Write an identity transform (input->parser->output, same output as input).
4. Modify the identity transform to suit your needs.
