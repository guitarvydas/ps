14. Itch.io game jams.  Source code is unencumbered.  Game writers need NPCs (basically Actors and concurrency).  I am looking at:

because I know oofoe and can ask him questions.

Programmers think that Racket and Clojure are futuristic.

- iOS phone software, need "youtube easiness" for creating iOS apps

- Descript, sequence editing - uses AI to match up spoken text with time sequences, allows Word-like editing of audio/video instead of the standard models based on mixing boards

- programming by example

- simplicity (simplicity == lack of nuance (no options, no parameters, etc.))

- strict, but easy-to-understand, rules - e.g. the way spreadsheets are rigid but flexible

OTOH: programmers are highly opinionated, and, highly indoctrinated and tend to think that diagrams cannot possibly help them.  Maybe we need to ignore existing programmers (wait for them to retire) and enable other domain experts, the way spreadsheets enabled doctors' office automation.  What do non-programmers want (but don't know to ask for)?

OTOH: you only need to involve pro programmers after an idea has been developed and beta-implemented

Programmers are anti-adept at making something visually pleasing.  Need to involve artists, e.g. collaborators.

I'm currently looking at:
- treesheets
- sector lisp, lambda lisp
