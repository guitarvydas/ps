- rrPI - raisin-sized rPI - GEM == generalized electronic machine
- 500 joints and sensors
- glue an rrPI onto each joint
- join all rrPIs together with wires
- each rrPI runs ONE single-threaded program, no operating system necessary, no reason to slap Linux onto an rrPI
- thread safety - not an issue
	- GEMs can't share memory, they can only send 1-way messages on wires
- draw network of rrPIs on a whiteboard, one box per rrPI, one arrow for each one-way message path
- Structured Message Passing - nested Russian Doll architecture of many layers of GEM boxes
- rule of 7
- if you need to use existing software, wrap that software in Linux, bolt Linux onto an rrPI, send the Linux package messages from the single-threaded program
- how to stay out of trouble - aka scaling - don't broadcast messages, use Structured Message Passing
- POCs
	- Arrowgrams
	- vsh
	- py0d
	- working n cl0d
	- existing software: e.g. equestrian medical sampler and controller
		- Python program on each GEM
