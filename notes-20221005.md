Advice sought: 

I want to reply to thread https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C5U3SEW6A/p1664945940180779

I wrote my reply as a markdown file elsewhere and it is more than a few lines long (~80 lines).  My options for posting the reply appear to be:

1. paste the whole reply into the tiny reply thread window
2. summarize (click-bait-ify) the reply and post a link to the rest in the reply thread
3. post the link to "linking-together", but, this is a reply, not a link to someone else's paper
4. *hopefully, I have missed some other option - advice / suggestions appreciated*

My reply text happens to be in Obsidian and will be Obsidian-Published to a URL in the ether.  More details gladly supplied on request.

Thanks

while I have your ear: are you aware of Descript?  I'm toying with it now and I like it better than Logic and Ableton for these speak-y kinds of things
