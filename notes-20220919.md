I am toying with the idea of creating a Discord for doing a re-jam on Cube Cat (and Ghost Stars).  My thoughts are here https://publish.obsidian.md/programmingsimplicity/2022-09-19-Project+Collaboration+Jams.  I haven't made these thoughts widely available yet and am willing to change this document (or to discard the idea).  What do you think?

opinions wanted: I am thinking of dumping Amazon Prime, and subscribing to some sort of basic set of TV channels (CBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, CTV, Global, etc, etc).  TekSaavy wants $20/mo but wants me to to change to their internet service and switch modems.  We have Bell Fibe (1.5G), but, Bell wants $40/mo and to make some hardware upgrades and is up-selling me on cloud-based PVR stuff that I don't really need.  I was expecting $10-$20/mo and no hardware changes.  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places?  Maybe one of the poorly-named stream services is all that I need (but I don't know which, because their names mean nothing to me).  I have an old Roku box and an old Apple TV box.

[TBD... notes to self]

> are you thinking of ad-hoc decentralized async friendly game-jam projects? I wonder how much room there is for such a fine-grained decipline separation (game eng. vs prod. eng. vs security eng.) feels that in such indie games most of these "hats" can be worn by the same person

interesting: this indicates that I have to define the difference between a "cottage industry" and "engineering"... ; back to the drawing board

This is not FBP.  I believe that a discussion of collaboration might be useful.  I post it to the FBP group since I think that the group is populated by innovators who might have interesting comments/discussions about this.  I was going to create a Discord server for this, but didn't get around to it.  My current thoughts are
