# Evolution of Visual Technologies for Concrete Expressions of Ideas: 
1. Cave Paintings
2. Impressions in clay using pointy sticks.
3. Indelible impressions on paper using ink
4. Delible impressions on paper using graphite, erasable with rubber.
...
2020s: delible images using electronics which can express perspective and 3D-ness and overlapping rectangles, erasable on command using electro-mechanical devices.

# SVG
In the 2020s, we have something called SVG, which is capable of expressing:
- rectangles
- lines
- groups
- ellipses
- text

Using a text-only representation for programs misses 4/5 of the above possibilities.

In the 1950s, "parser" technology was created based on what was parsable in the 1950s, i.e. ASCII characters arranged on a sequential grid of non-overlapping, small bitmaps.

In 2020s, we have Ohm-JS (and PEG) parser DSLs, and, we have a richer set of atomic units called *elements*.

Yet, we continue to use stunted atomic units called *characters*.
