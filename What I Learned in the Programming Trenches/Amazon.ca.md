Amazon.ca dumped gargbage on my doorstep and refuses to take responsibility for this.

I expect my elected officials to deal with Amazon on my behalf and to pass legislation so that this never happens again.

Details:

I ordered 3 jugs of popcorn.

When the order arrived in a cardboard box on my doorstep, one of the jugs was opened and spilled 2/3 of its contents into the box and onto my doorstep.

The jugs have screw-on lids.  The lid could not have simply fallen off in transit and must have been unscrewed by someone at Amazon or by one of Amazon's agents.

Amazon refuses to come over and clean up the remains.   Amazon is offering me a refund and a gift card. Neither of which cover my costs - (1) my time for dealing with this mistake, and, (2) cleaning staff indemnified by Amazon. 

I am not employed by Amazon.ca and do not expect to help Amazon.ca deal with this mistake.

I, and my wife, are 67 and retired.  I do not indemnify Amazon for any medical expenses arising from this mistake.
