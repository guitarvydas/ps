Hi Fare,

I apologize for not getting back you to sooner, but, life got in my way.

Our next meeting is Oct. 11 and the one after that is Nov. 8.  - every month on the 2nd Tuesday.  EDT.

If Oct. 11 is not too short a notice, you are welcome to speak.  Otherwise, any other month is OK, too.

Maybe you would like to pick a topic/talk?  We're not wed to lisp-only talks, but are always interested in fresh ideas and Alien Technology.

Every suggestion you made sounds interesting, so pick something that is easy and interesting for yourself.

If you want to attend without a talk (to scope us out, or just plain interest) you are welcome to do so, also.

thanks
pt

ps. did I send you our list of notes from previous meetings?  https://torlisp.neocities.org
